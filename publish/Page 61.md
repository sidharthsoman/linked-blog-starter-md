The vanaras sat stunned, seeing the vast ocean that stretched as far as the eye could see. They sat there clueless. They didn't even know if there was land beyond the ocean. They couldn't return without finding [[Sita]] for [[Sugriva]] was waiting back there to punish them if they returned empty-handed. [[Jambavanta]] looking at their helpless situation suggested they sing [[Rama]]'s story. He believed a solution would present itself to them if they did so. [[Angada]] sang "[[Jatayu]] laid down his life to protect [[Sita]]. He was a blessed soul who fought the mighty [[Ravana]]."

[[Jatayu]]'s elder brother [[Sampati]] who was in a cave in the [[Mahendra]] Mountain heard this. Once, [[Sampati]]'s wings were burnt and charred by the sun when he flew close to it. This had rendered him unable to fly. Hearing about his brother's death, he slowly walked out of the cave and shed tears. The vanaras were stunned looking at his huge stature.
