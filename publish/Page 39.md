With blood flowing from her nose and ears, [[Shurpanakha]] cried and wailed. She ran to [[Khara]], [[Dushana]] and [[Trishira]], roaring in grief and anger. She hid her mistake and exaggerated [[Lakshmana]]'s cruelty and urged the other rakshasas to attack [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]]. The rakshasas, lacking in wisdom, were easily provoked by her cries. Incited by her, fourteen thousand rakshasas marched toward [[Rama]]. But [[Rama]]'s arrows proved to be deadly. The demons didn't even make him sweat. They were all killed one by one. [[Shurpanakha]] who was hiding behind a tree and watching this was left clueless.
