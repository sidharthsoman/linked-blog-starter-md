After [[Ravana]] had argued with [[Sita]] and angrily left, the demonesses started to torment [[Sita]] in various ways. They frightened and exhausted her with their shouting, screaming, flying, and kicking. Feeling helpless, [[Sita]] stood under the tree and started to pull her hair out of frustration. Then, seeing her distress, a demoness named [[Trijata]], who had been scolding the other demonesses, cursed them and made them stop. "I had a dream that our king [[Ravana]] will be killed by [[Sita]]'s husband [[Rama]]. Fools, stop all this noise. Don't torment this woman. If she shows mercy, we will be saved." Hearing this, all the other demonesses gave up their attempts and fell silent.
