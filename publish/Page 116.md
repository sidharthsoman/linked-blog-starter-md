[[Ravana]]'s death left the throne empty. [[Vibhishana]] took his place on the throne as per [[Rama]]'s instructions. [[Vibhishana]] brought [[Sita]] before [[Rama]]. [[Sita]], her face radiant with joy after being reunited with [[Rama]], wept tears of relief. But [[Rama]]'s face remained grim. His voice, thick with anger and hurt, rang out: "How can I accept you back after you spent so much time with [[Ravana]]? My war with [[Ravana]] was not for you, but for the sake of my clan's honor. You are free to go wherever you wish." The vanara army was left speechless after hearing [[Rama]] utter those words. [[Hanuman]] was stunned to hear this. "Was he the same [[Rama]] who would look at [[Sita]]'s jewellery and cry for hours remembering her?" he wondered.
