"I will cross this ocean with the blessings of Lord [[Rama]]. Chant his name in reverence while I go to [[Lanka]] and find out about [[Sita]] Mata," said [[Hanuman]]. [[Hanuman]] grew in size and covered the [[Mahendra]] Mountain. The wild animals scattered in fright and the [[Yakshas]] ran away in any directions they could. He climbed to the peak and put all the weight of his body on the hill and roared. He bent his knees ready to leap. He prayed to [[Vayu Deva]], channeled all his powers and jumped to the sky in one mighty leap chanting [[Rama]]'s name. No sooner than [[Hanuman]] had begun his journey to [[Lanka]], the Vanaras had begun chanting [[Rama]]'s name.
