[[Rama]] prepared to cross the river [[Ganga]] by that boat. Since the border of [[Ayodhya]] ended there, the exile had officially begun. [[Sumantra]], who had to bid him farewell and return to [[Ayodhya]], felt as if he was drowning in a well of sorrow. [[Rama]] consoled him and said, "Tell [[Dasharatha]] that we are safe. We will come to [[Ayodhya]] as soon as the period of exile is over, without a moment's delay." The chariot had been turned around facing [[Ayodhya]]. The chariot had begun its journey to the kingdom without its king.
