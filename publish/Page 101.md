[[Nila]] danced and mocked [[Ravana]] by pulling off his crown and shaking his flagpole. This enraged [[Ravana]], who then used the [[Agneyastra]] weapon on [[Nila]]. However, [[Nila]] being the son of [[Agni]], the fire god was not harmed. Seeing [[Rama]] standing on the ground, [[Hanuman]] immediately lifted him onto his shoulders and brought him to the battlefield, determined not to let [[Ravana]] gain the upper hand. [[Hanuman]] became both [[Rama]]'s chariot and charioteer. [[Ravana]]'s face was etched with worry as he was struck by countless arrows from [[Rama]]'s bow and was getting tired. [[Rama]] then asked [[Ravana]] to return to [[Lanka]], defeated. [[Ravana]]'s chariot retreated from the battlefield.
