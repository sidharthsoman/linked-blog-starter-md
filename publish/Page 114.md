[[Mandodari]] came with her maids to see [[Ravana]]'s body. She was overcome with grief and cried, "Even after conquering [[Indra]] and other gods, you could not conquer your senses. You desired [[Sita]], a woman of great virtue, and brought death upon yourself. Because of your lust and anger, all the brave warriors of the Rakshasa race have been destroyed." She wept bitterly, her cries of sorrow echoed across the battlefield. Initially, [[Vibhishana]] refused to perform the last rites for [[Ravana]]. However, [[Rama]] persuaded him, saying, "Whatever the enmity between you two, it should end with his death. It is your duty as a brother to perform his last rites."
