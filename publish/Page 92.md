Even though there was no way around the situation, [[Rama]] wanted to follow the king's dharma of trying for peace till the very end and sent [[Angada]] as a messenger to [[Ravana]]. "Do not fight with [[Rama]]. If you hand over [[Sita]] to [[Rama]], there will be no cause of war. It is not right for millions of rakshasas to die because of your stubbornness," said [[Angada]]. [[Ravana]], enraged by [[Angada]]'s words, shouted, "Catch him, kill him, tear him apart!" The soldiers came forward to grab his arms. [[Angada]] lifted them all in his arms, tossed them into the air and slammed them to the ground. Everyone who rushed forward fell to the ground. [[Angada]], without stopping, jumped, and leaped in all directions, uprooted the golden tower of [[Ravana]]'s palace, and finally reached [[Rama]]'s camp.
