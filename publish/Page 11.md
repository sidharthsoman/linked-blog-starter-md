[[Mithila]] was the capital of the [[Videha]] kingdom. [[Nimi]]'s descendant, [[Siradhwaja]], was the king there. [[Janaka]] was his other name. While [[Janaka]] was plowing the earth, a divine child was found at the tip of the plough. Believing it to be a divine blessing, [[Janaka]] adopted the daughter. She was called [[Janaki]]. She was also called [[Vaidehi]] since she was the princess of [[Videha]], and she was called [[Maithili]] since she was the child of [[Mithila]]. When she came of age, he decided to give her in marriage to a suitable groom. He organized a swayamvara. He declared [[Sita]]'s marriage with the challenge of [[Shiva]] Dhanush, which was blessed to his lineage by [[Maheshwara]]. Princes from faraway lands came, but none were able to even lift the [[Shiva]] Dhanush, let alone string it.
