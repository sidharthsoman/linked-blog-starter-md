[[Rama]] laughed at [[Lakshmana]]. "Our [[Bharata]] is not like that. He would never kill brothers for the throne. Please calm down," he said. [[Bharata]] who came to [[Chitrakuta]], saw [[Rama]], [[Sita]] and [[Lakshmana]]. He then bowed down to his elder brother and his sister-in-law and informed them about the death of King [[Dasharatha]]. The flood gates in [[Rama]]'s heart opened when he heard the news that his father had died. [[Sita]] and [[Lakshmana]] were equally in pain. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] conducted the final ritual at sunset under the guidance of [[Vasishtha]]. [[Bharata]] later pleaded with [[Rama]] to abandon the vow of exile and return to [[Ayodhya]]. He pleaded in various ways but all his pleas went in vain. [[Rama]]'s determination to fulfill his father's words was not shaken even a bit by [[Bharata]]'s tears. Helpless to make his brother return to [[Ayodhya]], [[Bharata]] placed darba grass on the ground and proceeded to end his life.
