[[Hanuman]] rushed to [[Ashokavana]] to convey the good news of [[Ravana]]'s death and [[Rama]]'s victory to [[Sita]]. Upon hearing the news, [[Sita]] was overjoyed. Seeing the Rakshasa women who had surrounded and tormented her all this time, "If you permit me, I will kill them all and send them to [[Yama Puri]]," [[Hanuman]], with eyes blazing with anger, roared. "No please!" pleaded [[Sita]]. "They were just carrying out the orders of their king. My suffering is my own karma, and they are not to be blamed." [[Sita]] then expressed her desire to see [[Rama]]. [[Hanuman]] immediately flew back to [[Rama]] to convey [[Sita]]'s message.
