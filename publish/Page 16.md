[[Manthara]] was alert when she found out that [[Dasharatha]] was on his way to meet [[Kaikeyi]]. "Your old husband will act as if he is heartbroken when you ask him to fulfill his promises. He may even beg you to reconsider. Don't listen to anything he has to say," she trained [[Kaikeyi]]. [[Dasharatha]] found [[Kaikeyi]] distressed when he visited her that night. Her eyes were filled with anger and all jewelry was strewn across the floor. [[Kaikeyi]] stopped [[Dasharatha]] from consoling her and instead blurted all that was told to her by [[Manthara]]. [[Dasharatha]] was stunned to hear her conditions. He pleaded with [[Kaikeyi]] to reconsider, but she was adamant. He was bound by his promises and could not refuse her demands. He cried but to no avail. [[Kaikeyi]] remained unmoved.
