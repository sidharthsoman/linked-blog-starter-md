[[Kausalya]] who saw [[Bharata]] entering her inner palace, could not control her anger. Her words flowed out without control. [[Kausalya]] cursed [[Bharata]], calling him a cunning and greedy person who desired the kingdom. [[Bharata]] who had never heard such harsh words from her was stunned. He fell to the ground, and begged for her forgiveness. He said, "Mother, I have no part in my mother's evil deeds. It was she who desired the kingdom, not me."

"How can I live happily after sending [[Rama]] to the forest? What is the use of a kingdom without him? What is the point of becoming an emperor in a land without my brother? If I am guilty then let all the evils of the world befall me." Realizing his pure heart, [[Kausalya]] came back to reality, controlled her anger and hugged the innocent [[Bharata]] in her lap. She comforted him, comforting herself as well.
