All the rituals of [[Dasharatha]]'s death were over. Sage [[Vasishtha]] along with other ministers decided to conduct the coronation of [[Bharata]]. He strongly objected to their decision. "I will go to the forest and bring [[Rama]] back to [[Ayodhya]]. Only he is eligible to succeed our father," he said and left for [[Chitrakuta]] with all the elders. The noise of the group's chatter frightened the peaceful animals and birds of the surroundings. [[Lakshmana]] who was guarding [[Rama]] felt a sense of danger after hearing the commotion. He looked around and saw [[Bharata]]'s army approaching. He thought that this army must have come to kill [[Rama]] and became enraged. "Look at this brother! [[Bharata]] has lost his mind because of the power and has come here to kill you along with his army. I will destroy this army," he roared.
