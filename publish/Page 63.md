[[Sampati]] got his wings back but what about them? The Vanaras gathered on the banks of the ocean, wondering how to cross it. They just sat there unable to think of any ways to cross the ocean. If any more time was wasted, they would get hungry and that would be the end of their mission. Finally [[Angada]] called together all the vanara warriors and asked them for their ideas. He asked them how far they could jump. [[Gaja]] and [[Gavaksha]] said they could cover twenty yojanas in a single jump. [[Rishabha]] said he could jump forty yojanas while [[Gandhamada]] said fifty yojanas. [[Mainda]] and [[Dwivida]] said sixty and seventy yojanas respectively. [[Tara]] said he could easily jump eighty yojanas. Old [[Jambavanta]], not realizing his limitations said he could jump 90 yojanas, and [[Angada]] said he could fly 100 yojanas, but he's not sure if he can make it back.
