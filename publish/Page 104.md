Enraged by the Vanara's mischief, half tired, half irritated, and boiling with rage, [[Kumbhakarna]] re-entered the battlefield. He grabbed Vanaras in his hands and stuffed them into his mouth. Some Vanaras came out of his ears, and some came out of his nostrils.

Others poked out of the gaps in his armor. Vanara heroes from the neighboring hills leaped onto [[Kumbhakarna]]'s body. Because of the Vanaras clinging all over him, he looked like a mountain range covered in hundreds of trees.
