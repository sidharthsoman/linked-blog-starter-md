[[Hanuman]] descended from the tree and approached [[Sita]]. He gave her the ring with [[Rama]]'s name on it. As soon as she saw it, [[Sita]] was overwhelmed with emotion. Tears welled up in her eyes and her body trembled. [[Hanuman]] then said, "Mother, [[Rama]] will come. He will definitely destroy [[Lanka]], kill the demon [[Ravana]], and rescue you. Please give me some token as a sign of our meeting." He held out his palm humbly. [[Sita]] gave him a piece of jewellery that she had tied in her sari. [[Hanuman]] then left after bidding her farewell.
