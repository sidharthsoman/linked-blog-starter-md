[[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] started south. Then, long arms appeared out of nowhere and grasped them. When they looked, it was a strange figure. There was no head, but a mouth in the stomach, teeth inside the mouth, one eye in the chest, with fire in it. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] cut off the arms of this strange figure. Immediately, the form was liberated from the curse. He now began to tell his story. He was [[Kabandha]], a rakshasa. Due to the curses of [[Indra]] and a sage, he had gotten this bad form. He was blessed with liberation from the curse by [[Rama]]. As soon as [[Kabandha]]'s body was burnt as per his request, he got a divine body. He stood in the sky and said "O [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]], go to the banks of the [[Pampa]]. Meet [[Sugriva]] in the [[Rishyamukha Giri]]. [[Rama]], [[Shabari]] is waiting for you in the [[Matanga]] ashram." He disappeared after giving the advice.
