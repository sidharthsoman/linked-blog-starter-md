[[Dasharatha]]'s son first tried to calmly explain things to [[Shurpanakha]]. However, her sole desire was to have [[Rama]] as her husband. [[Rama]] rejected her advances politely by saying that he had taken a vow to be married only to one woman. [[Shurpanakha]]'s attention shifted to [[Sita]]. "You want to be married only to one woman? That can be arranged. I will kill [[Sita]] and marry you. Your vow will not be broken," she declared. "I will marry you at any cost," she proclaimed and pounced on [[Sita]]. [[Rama]] instantly signaled to his brother [[Lakshmana]]. Before the rakshasi could attack [[Sita]] and cause harm, [[Saumitri]]'s sharp sword flashed and cut off [[Shurpanakha]]'s nose and ears. Blood oozed out. "Evil demon, I never attack a woman. Learn your lesson and leave this instant," [[Lakshmana]] said. Howling in pain and humiliation, that demoness disappeared into the darkness of the forest.
