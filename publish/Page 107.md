[[Hanuman]] could single-handedly save [[Rama]]'s army said [[Jambavan]]. He asked him to fetch four medicinal herbs from the mountain between [[Vrishaba]] and [[Kailasa]] mountains. [[Hanuman]] immediately flew up into the sky in the darkness and brought back not just the herbs, but the entire mountain. As the scent from the herbs wafted, all the Vanara warriors who had fainted woke up. Their wounds healed, their bones joined, their skin grew back and their consciousness returned by [[Vishalyakarani]], [[Sandhanakarani]], [[Savarnyakarani]] and [[Mritasanjeevini]] respectively. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] also woke up thanks to the [[Sanjeevini]] herbs. Following [[Jambavan]]'s advice, [[Hanuman]] then put the mountain back in its place. [[Ravana]] had advised his soldiers to throw all the dead rakshasas into the sea because of which they could not be revived by the power of the herbs.
