[[Rama]] had vanquished many rakshasas in [[Dandakaranya]] but only one remained. He was [[Akampana]]. He immediately went to [[Lanka]] and reported to [[Ravana]], the king of rakshasas. He told [[Ravana]] that [[Sita]] was [[Rama]]'s life, and if he abducted her, [[Rama]] would die of grief. Hearing this, [[Ravana]], who was already blinded with desire for [[Sita]], immediately flew in his chariot to [[Maricha]]'s ashram. He asked [[Maricha]] to help him abduct [[Sita]]. However, [[Maricha]], who had already experienced [[Rama]]'s power, refused. When [[Ravana]] heard about [[Rama]]'s bravery, he gave up the idea of abducting [[Sita]] and returned to [[Lanka]].
