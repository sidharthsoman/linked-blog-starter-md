Twelve years had passed since the swayamvara. [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] had a harmonious marriage. The people of [[Ayodhya]] had immense affection for [[Rama]]. [[Rama]] was the embodiment of love for King [[Dasharatha]]. Realizing that old age had caught up with him, [[Dasharatha]] decided to crown [[Rama]] as the king. He called upon the scholars, elders, and ministers and expressed his desire. "[[Rama]] is a treasure trove of good qualities. He understands dharma. He is soft-spoken, brave, and truthful. He is also very generous. Nobody can match his humbleness, love, and affection he shows to the citizens. He is smart and is an expert in everything. He is fit to be the king of the noble kingdom," he said. Everyone agreed that [[Rama]] was fit to be the king in all respects.
