	

The thirteen years of forest life of [[Rama]] was about to end in the pleasant environment of [[Panchavati]]. One afternoon in the month of [[Margashira]], an old she-demon with a hefty and ugly body suddenly jumped into the area in front of the cottage of [[Rama]] and laughed derisively. She was [[Shurpanakha]], the sister of [[Ravana]]. She was fascinated by the handsome and graceful personality of [[Rama]].

She narrated the history of [[Ravana]], [[Kumbhakarna]], and [[Vibhishana]]. She said [[Khara]] and [[Dushana]] who are ruling over this forest were her brothers. [[Rama]] too narrated his whole story as it was. [[Shurpanakha]] pleaded, became obstinate and said, "I am capable of taking any shape I desire. The whole of this [[Dandakaranya]] is in my custody. You must marry me."
