[[Ravana]]'s intention was to not miss any opportunity to weaken [[Rama]]. For that, he took refuge in deception. A demon named [[Shuka]], who came in the form of a parrot as [[Ravana]]'s messenger, met [[Sugriva]] alone and said, "If [[Ravana]] abducts [[Sita]], what is the benefit to you? You leave all these troubles and go to [[Kishkindha]] peacefully and rule the kingdom." The vanaras, who smelled [[Shuka]]'s mean intention, attacked him fiercely and drove him away. Caught in these beatings, [[Shuka]] folded his hands to [[Rama]] and begged for his life. "It is against the king's Dharma to beat the messenger. Let him go," said [[Rama]]. Only then did [[Shuka]] get relief from Vanaras.
