[[Maricha]]'s maya mruga greatly troubled [[Rama]]. When he was certain that it was impossible to capture it alive, [[Rama]] shot an arrow. It pierced [[Maricha]]'s heart. While dying, [[Maricha]] mimicked [[Rama]]'s voice and cried out, "Oh [[Sita]], oh [[Lakshmana]]" and fell to the ground. Hearing this cry, [[Sita]], fearing that [[Rama]] himself was in trouble asked [[Lakshmana]] to go and see him. When [[Lakshmana]] said that this was all the work of rakshasas, [[Sita]] became furious. She insulted [[Lakshmana]] with abusive words. Hurt by this, [[Lakshmana]] with a heavy heart, picked up his bow and arrows and ran towards the source of [[Rama]]'s cry, disappearing into the darkness of the forest.
