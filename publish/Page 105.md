The Vanaras saw that [[Rama]] was the only one who could defeat this giant. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] fought [[Kumbhakarna]] with their arrows. [[Rama]] fired the [[Vayavya]], [[Aindra]], and [[Ardhachandra]] arrows, cutting off [[Kumbhakarna]]'s arms and legs. But the relentless demon, undeterred, opened his mouth wide to swallow [[Rama]]. [[Rama]] then used the divine [[Aindrastra]] to sever the demon's neck. As his head fell, it smashed into the buildings causing them to crumble. The headless, limbless torso rolled away finally falling into the sea.
