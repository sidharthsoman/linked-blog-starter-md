[[Vishwamitra]] showed [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] all the wonders of nature. He lovingly told them the stories of [[Rama]]'s ancestors as they crossed the [[Sarayu]] river. He taught [[Rama]] the powerful mantra "bala ati bala", meaning 'strength upon strength'. As they entered the [[Malada-Karoosha]] forest, the fearsome demon [[Tataka]] attacked them. She pointed at the princes and asked [[Vishwamitra]], "Who are these infants that you have brought? Their meat won't even be enough for a single meal." She looked at the boys and yelled, "Just wait and watch how I peel them like a banana and then I will eat you up in just one bite." She leaped into action and sprang towards them. Without missing a beat, [[Rama]] pierced her with a sharp arrow and ended her.
