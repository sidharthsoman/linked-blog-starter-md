[[Rama]]'s face remained calm. "There is no greater virtue than obeying a father's words. Look, I am leaving for the forest right now. Let [[Bharata]] be the king. May he rule the kingdom with love for the people and uphold righteousness," said [[Rama]]. He then took blessings of both [[Dasharatha]] and [[Kaikeyi]] and left for the forest. [[Lakshmana]] was furious on hearing this. He couldn't bear the injustice his brother was facing. He was ready to revolt against [[Kaikeyi]] and [[Bharata]]. He argued angrily that [[Kaikeyi]]'s demands were unfair. However, [[Rama]] stopped [[Lakshmana]]. He reminded him that it was their duty to obey their father's commands, no matter how painful they might be. He stated that they must respect [[Kaikeyi]]'s wishes. [[Rama]]'s words calmed down [[Lakshmana]] and he decided to accompany [[Rama]] to the forest. [[Sita]] too expressed her desire to accompany [[Rama]] to the forest. She stated that she as his wife couldn't leave him alone in such difficult times. She followed him to the forest.
