[[Maricha]] who could assume any desired form assumed the form of a magical golden deer, arrived in the banana grove next to [[Rama]]'s hut. It danced and pranced in various ways, catching [[Sita]]'s eye. Seeing emeralds, and hooves like diamonds, [[Sita]]'s resolute mind faltered. She wanted this deer at any cost. She pestered her husband [[Rama]] to bring her the golden deer.

Ignoring [[Lakshmana]]'s suspicion that this might be a demon's illusion, [[Rama]] went after the deer. The deer gave [[Rama]] a tough time. It galloped and changed directions making it difficult to be captured. On one hand, [[Rama]] was determined to catch this deer. On the other hand, the deer, which had planned to lure [[Rama]] far away from cottage, was leaping further and further away.
