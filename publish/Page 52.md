The brothers [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] advanced toward the [[Rishyamuka]] mountain while looking at the beauty of the [[Pampa]] Lake. [[Sugriva]], who was sitting with his people, grew curious about these two divine figures. He sent his minister [[Hanuman]] to find out who they were, as he suspected they might be from [[Vali]], his elder brother who was trying to kill him. [[Hanuman]]'s father is [[Kesari]], the king of Vanaras. He was born to [[Anjana Devi]] by the grace of god [[Vayu]]. [[Hanuman]], also known as [[Pavana Putra]] and [[Anjaneya]], was a shape shifter. He went to [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] disguised as a monk. He introduced himself and asked about [[Rama]]. [[Rama]] was impressed by [[Hanuman]]'s eloquence. As soon as he saw [[Rama]]'s noble and righteous personality, [[Hanuman]] developed a sense of devotion towards him. The two of them got closer to each other with mutual respect, as if they were old friends.
