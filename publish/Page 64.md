While all this discussion was going on, [[Hanuman]] was just sitting silently. [[Jambavanta]], who knew about his true potential, called [[Hanuman]] up, "Oh, brave warrior. Why are you sitting there silently? Didn't you hear [[Sampati]] give us a clear indication that [[Sita]] was in [[Lanka]]? You are faster than [[Garuda]]. Can't you go there and find out about [[Sita]]?" [[Jambavanta]] reminded him of all the adventurous things he did as a child. In fact, [[Hanuman]] had a curse that if someone didn't remind him of his true powers, he would forget them. So [[Jambavanta]] revived [[Hanuman]]'s memory by reminding him of all his jumping feats. This rekindled the power in [[Hanuman]]. He, who was sitting dully, got up with great enthusiasm. As he stood up, he grew bigger and bigger, until he was finally as tall as the sky. The other Vanaras watched this amazing sight with awe and wonder.
