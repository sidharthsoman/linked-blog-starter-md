[[Kosala]] was the land blessed where the [[Sarayu]] River flows. The capital of that vast kingdom was [[Ayodhya]], which seemed impossible for enemies to conquer. It was built by the legendary emperor, [[Manu]] of the [[Surya dynasty]]. There were many famous kings in the lineage like [[Ikshvaku]], [[Pruthu]], [[Dudumara]], [[Mandhaata]], [[Ambarisha]], [[Satyavrata]], [[Harischandra]], [[Sagara]], [[Dilipa]], [[Bhagiratha]] and [[Raghu]]. Among the other famous kings of that lineage was [[Aja]]. His son was [[Dasharatha]]. He had three queens [[Kausalya]], [[Sumitra]], and [[Kaikeyi]]. They had everything they could imagine but lacked in one thing. Even though they had grown old, King [[Dasharatha]] and his queens did not have children yet. The sadness of the king touched the heart of [[Vasishtha]].
