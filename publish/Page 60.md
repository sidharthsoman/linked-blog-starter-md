[[Sita]]'s search party headed south. The leader of the group was [[Angada]]. As the group kept moving forward, they saw the mouth of a cave in the middle of a dense forest. The vanaras noticed that birds were coming out of the cave in large flocks. They guessed that there might be water there and went inside. But there, a big, eye-catching structure stood tall. It was a cave city built by [[Maya]]. In that cave city, [[Swayamprabha]], a Yogini, was sitting in a yoga posture. [[Hanuman]] approached her and explained all about their journey. She offered food and drinks to all the Vanaras. After they finished eating, she asked the Vanaras to close their eyes tightly. When they opened their eyes, they were no longer in her cave, they were standing in front of a vast blue ocean.
