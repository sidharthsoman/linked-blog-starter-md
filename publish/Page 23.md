[[Guha]] brought banyan tree sap for [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] to tie their hair. [[Sita]] got into the boat first, then [[Rama]] followed, chanting a hymn. He bowed to the [[Ganga]]. [[Sita]], sitting in the boat, bowed to the [[Ganga]] and said, "Oh [[Ganga]], with your grace may [[Rama]] return to [[Ayodhya]] with me and his brother [[Lakshmana]]." The boat sailed crossing the vast [[Ganga]] and reached the southern bank. After crossing the river and reaching the bank, [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]], and [[Sita]] entered the forest. They had reached an important stage of their exile in the forest. In the front was [[Lakshmana]], followed by [[Sita]] and [[Rama]] in the end. [[Rama]] hadn't gotten upset when he was asked to go on exile, neither was he sad when he had left his mother behind or give up the kingdom, but he was heartbroken when he saw [[Sita]] scared while entering the forest. He kept silent thinking about the distress she was going through.
