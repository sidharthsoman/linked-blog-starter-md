As soon as King [[Janaka]] found out that sage [[Vishwamitra]] was arriving at his palace, he reached the main entrance to welcome the sage with respect. The king touched the sage's feet and sought his blessings. [[Janaka]] was happy as soon as [[Vishwamitra]] informed that [[Rama]] was interested to see the [[Shiva]] Dhanush. The [[Shiva]] Dhanush was brought to them on an eight-wheeled chariot. As per [[Vishwamitra]]'s words, [[Rama]] lifted the bow as if it were made of flowers and strung the divine bow and twanged the string. The bow broke with a tremendous sound. The people of [[Mithila]] were amazed. [[Janaka]] was delighted and he got his daughter [[Sita]] married to [[Rama]]. The people of [[Ayodhya]] arrived in [[Mithila]]. [[Sita]] was married to [[Rama]]. [[Janaka]]'s daughter [[Urmila]] was married to [[Lakshmana]]. [[Janaka]]'s younger brother [[Kushadhwaja]]'s daughters [[Mandavi]] and [[Shrutakirti]] were married to [[Bharata]] and [[Shatrughna]] respectively. After the wedding ceremony was performed auspiciously, [[Vishwamitra]] went towards the [[Himalaya]]. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] started for [[Ayodhya]]. [[Bharata]] and [[Shatrughna]] with their wives were called by [[Bharata]]'s maternal uncle [[Yudhajit]] to [[Kekaya]].
