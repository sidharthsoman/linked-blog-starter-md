The hunchbacked [[Manthara]] ran to [[Kaikeyi]] immediately. [[Manthara]] told [[Kaikeyi]] that people would praise [[Rama]] and forget [[Bharata]]. She added that [[Kaikeyi]] would never become a Rajamata and that title would go to [[Kausalya]], and she would be like a maid to [[Kausalya]]. She constantly repeated the same thing and changed [[Kaikeyi]]'s perception towards [[Rama]]. [[Kaikeyi]], who loved [[Rama]] like her own son, was now filled with envy. "You were given two boons by King [[Dasharatha]]. This is the right moment to ask for it. Make [[Rama]] go to the forest in exile for fourteen years and ask for [[Bharata]] to become the king," [[Manthara]] said to [[Kaikeyi]].
