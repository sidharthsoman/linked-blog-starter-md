It had been five days since [[Rama]] had begun his exile. The sun rose as usual but the king of [[Surya]] vansha didn't. [[Dasharatha]] died of grief. [[Kausalya]] and [[Sumitra]] were also present, but they had fainted from grief at the time of [[Dasharatha]]'s death. The entire kingdom wept upon hearing the news of [[Dasharatha]]'s death. The fate of [[Ayodhya]] had turned upside down. The people blamed evil [[Kaikeyi]] for this. Sage [[Vasishtha]] visited the palace upon hearing the bad news. He consoled everyone and asked [[Bharata]] and [[Shatrughna]] to return from [[Kaikeyi]]'s father's home. The sage then ordered for the earthly remains of the king to be preserved till the princes returned.
