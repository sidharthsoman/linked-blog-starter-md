[[Vishwamitra]] started performing the rituals of the yajna after reaching [[Siddhashrama]]. The task of guarding the yajnashala fell upon [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]]. On the sixth day, [[Tataka]]'s sons, [[Subahu]] and [[Maricha]], along with their demon army, unexpectedly appeared in the sky to attack the yajnashala. They roared and prepared to shower the sacrificial fire with flesh and blood. [[Rama]] saw this and immediately acted. He used the [[Manavastra]] on [[Maricha]], which sent him flying a hundred yojanas away. [[Rama]] used the [[Agneyastra]], which killed [[Subahu]]. The entire demon army was terrified of [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]]. Thus the yajna was completed without any obstacles. Later, [[Vishwamitra]], along with the two brave boys, set out for [[Mithila]].
