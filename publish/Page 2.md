As soon as this curse came from his mouth, the maharishi was grief-stricken for the dead bird, felt sorry for the bird that was going to be lonely. He also felt sorry for having cursed the hunter. [[Brahmadeva]] appeared when he was grieving and consoled the maharishi. The curse you have spoken is in the form of a verse. Write a poem about [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] in a similar way, he suggested. He also gave a boon that the inner and outer nature of every character in the [[Ramayana]] poem and every event appear before him as if it is happening right in front of him. Thus it is said that [[Valmiki]] maharishi composed the [[Ramayana]] with his creativity and the help of [[Brahmadeva]]'s boon.
