On the way across the ocean, the Gods decided to test [[Hanuman]]'s character. As part of this, they sent a [[Naga]] Mata named [[Surasa]]. She rose from the water, appeared before [[Hanuman]], and ordered him, "I have come to eat you. Come to my mouth." [[Hanuman]], who was on his way to find [[Sita]], told her that he couldn't delay and would become her food when he returned. [[Surasa]] didn't agree. So, [[Hanuman]] said, "Make your mouth big enough for my body." Not knowing [[Hanuman]]'s cleverness, [[Surasa]] opened her mouth wide. [[Hanuman]] grew bigger, and as her mouth grew bigger, [[Hanuman]] suddenly shrunk himself to the size of a thumb and jumped into her mouth and then flew back up into the sky. [[Surasa]], impressed by [[Hanuman]]'s intelligence, wished him luck for his mission.
