[[Rama]] having killed [[Maricha]], was returning to their ashram. [[Lakshmana]], who had gone out to look for [[Rama]], met him and explained how [[Sita]] had yelled at him and sent him in search of [[Rama]]. [[Maricha]] taking the form of golden deer just to lure [[Rama]] away and calling out for help in [[Rama]]'s voice before dying gave birth to suspicions. Sensing danger, both rushed back to the ashram. They were stunned to see the ashram was empty. [[Sita]] was nowhere to be found. Searching frantically for her around the forest, in the mountains, and by the rivers, [[Rama]] cried out in anguish, "[[Sita]], where are you?" [[Lakshmana]] comforted his grief-stricken brother.
