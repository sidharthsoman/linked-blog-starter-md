As [[Hanuman]] leaped to cross the ocean, the sea creatures were scared and fled. The fish, unable to find shelter, trembled. The ocean, which was already turbulent, danced even more wildly. From within the waves, Mount [[Mainaka]] rose. [[Hanuman]] gently touched the mountain that had come in his way. [[Mainaka]], who had been helped by [[Vayu Deva]], now felt affection for [[Hanuman]], who was blessed by [[Vayu Deva]]. "You are the son of [[Vayu Deva]] who once saved me. Helping you is my Dharma. It is very tiring to cross the ocean. Rest here for a while and consume the fruits and then go," said [[Mainaka]]. [[Hanuman]] replied, "Forgive me, [[Mainaka]]. I must finish the task entrusted to me as soon as possible. There is no room for delay now. Thank you for your invitation. I can never get tired while I serve Lord [[Rama]]." Without waiting for another moment, he flew on.
