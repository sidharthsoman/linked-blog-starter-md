[[Hanuman]] landed at the [[Trikootachala]] hill in [[Lanka]]. From there, he looked towards the golden [[Lanka]]. He was speechless by the magnificence of [[Ravana]]'s kingdom. He waited inside [[Lanka]] until sunset, hiding from sunrise to sunset. When the moon rose, he reduced his body to the size of a cat and slowly and silently entered the city gate. Then, the guardian deity of [[Lanka]] stopped him. She looked at him with fierce eyes. She started questioning him, asking who he was. [[Hanuman]]'s playful answer, "I just came to see this beautiful city and will leave as I came," enraged her. She tried to kick him out. [[Hanuman]] lost his control. He roared, raised his left fist, and punched her. She, who was struck by his blow, fell. That is when she remembered [[Brahma Deva]]'s words. It became clear to her that [[Sita]]'s abduction was the beginning of [[Lanka]]'s downfall. She allowed [[Hanuman]] to enter [[Lanka]].
