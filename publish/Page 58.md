[[Sugriva]] was crowned as the king of [[Kishkindha]]. Now, the task of finding [[Sita]] remained. It was still the rainy season. [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]] came to a consent that the search should begin after the rainy season, once the month of [[Karthika]] started. However, even after many days had passed since the rainy season ended, he did not pay any heed to the promise he had made to [[Rama]]. He completely ignored the promise and reveled in the luxurious life of the [[Kishkindha]] palace. This angered [[Rama]]. [[Lakshmana]] who came to remind [[Sugriva]] of [[Rama]]'s words, warned him angrily, saying, "If you are not ready to start the search for [[Sita]], be prepared to fight." [[Sugriva]] was stunned. [[Tara]] tried to pacify [[Lakshmana]]'s anger. She explained that they had already sent the Vanara warriors for the search. [[Sugriva]] also apologized for his mistake.
