[[Hanuman]] was put on trial. "I am [[Hanuman]], the messenger of [[Rama]], [[Sugriva]]'s Minister. You should surrender to [[Rama]] and return [[Sita]] Mata to him and repent for what you have done," he said firmly. [[Lankesh]] was livid and sentenced [[Hanuman]] to death. [[Ravana]]'s brother [[Vibhishana]] stood up and argued that "killing a messenger is against all laws. If you must, disfigure him instead."

[[Ravana]] agreed and instead of death penalty, ordered that [[Hanuman]]'s tail be set on fire. He reasoned that since the tail is an ornament to Vanaras, disfiguring it would be like striking them at their core. So, bundles of cloth and pots of oil were prepared to set [[Hanuman]]'s tail on fire. They wrapped the cloths around his growing tail and finally set it on fire. [[Hanuman]] was then paraded through the city with his hands tied behind his back.
