As the chariot carrying [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]], and [[Sita]] crossed the [[Tamasa]] river, it was nightfall. On a palanquin made of leaves, [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] were to sleep. [[Lakshmana]], who had been awake all night, kept guard. The crowd that had followed them from [[Ayodhya]] dispersed in all directions to rest. Before dawn, [[Rama]] started the chariot again. The chariot moved north, south, and again north to deliberately confuse the people and then disappeared from sight. When the people woke up and rubbed their eyes, they saw the marks of the chariot wheels and were unsure with regards to the direction it had gone. Lost and without a way, they all eventually returned to [[Ayodhya]].
