[[Sampati]] approached the vanaras and asked them about the death of his brother, [[Jatayu]]. [[Angada]] explained the story in brief and informed him that they are in search of [[Sita]]. Then [[Sampati]] said, "It is true, I saw [[Ravana]] take away a young woman. I can see things that happen a hundred yojanas away. There beyond that shore, [[Sita]] is imprisoned. Cross the sea and go to [[Lanka]]." As he was saying this his wings sprouted back. [[Sampati]] who had the boon that his burnt wings would grow back if he helped [[Rama]], was overjoyed by this. "I have done my duty for [[Rama]]'s work! My wings have come back!" Saying this, [[Sampati]] happily flew into the sky and disappeared.
