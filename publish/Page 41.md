[[Vishravasu]] was the son of [[Pulastya]], one of the manasa putra of [[Brahmadeva]]. [[Ravana]] was the son of [[Vishravasu]] and a rakshasa woman [[Kaikasi]]. The king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]], the lord of the three worlds, renowned for his might and prowess, who could bend even the Gods to his will, who could grow ten heads and twenty arms if he wished - a powerful being was untouched by the fear of death. This kind of power had rightly given birth to arrogance in him. As he was proudly conducting his court, adorned with all his ornaments, his sister [[Shurpanakha]] approached him. Looking even more ferocious than usual, she entered, wailing, tearing at her clothes, and rolling on the ground. In various ways, she tried to incite her brother. "For your sake, I went to bring [[Sita]], the beautiful wife of [[Rama]]. But he insulted me, cutting off my nose and ears," she said. She repeatedly described [[Sita]]'s beauty, hoping to inflame his desire. But [[Rama]]'s rejection was the ultimate insult, exceeding any physical injury. It was the fire that ignited [[Ravana]]'s passion.
