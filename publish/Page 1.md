Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashram was on the banks of [[Tamasa]] River. One day, he went to take a bath in the river. As he reached the banks of the river, he noticed a pair of herons engrossed in love in a tree. At the same time, a hunter who was hiding there shot an arrow at the birds. The arrow hit the male bird, which fluttered in pain, screeched, fell down and died and the female bird cried. The sage, who was deeply thinking about the story of [[Rama]] and [[Sita]], saw this sudden tragedy before his eyes and was filled with grief. He cursed the hunter: "Oh hunter, may you be cursed with a short life for killing one of a pair of love-stricken birds."
