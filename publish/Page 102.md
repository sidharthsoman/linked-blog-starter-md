[[Ravana]]'s brother [[Kumbhakarna]] had a boon from [[Brahma]] that he would sleep for six months and then wake up and eat for one day. When the time came for him to wake up, [[Ravana]] decided to send him to the battlefield. He had prepared mountains of meat and drinks for [[Kumbhakarna]] to eat after he woke up. They blew conch shells, beat drums and gongs, pricked him with needles, poured water in his ears, beat him with clubs, tied ropes to his body and dragged him, and even shouted in his ears.

Nothing woke him up. Finally, a thousand elephants were made to run over him. Only then did [[Kumbhakarna]] stir. He woke up and looked around. He saw mountains of food and drink and was overjoyed. Having finished all the food in record time, he asked why he had been woken up. The soldiers, trembling with fear, explained the situation. [[Kumbhakarna]] understood and immediately set off to [[Ravana]]'s court, taking large strides.
