The enemy's army was diminishing. The demon warriors [[Trishira]], [[Devantaka]], [[Narantaka]], [[Mahodara]], and others were slain by the Vanara army and lay dead on the battlefield. [[Lakshmana]] had killed [[Ravana]]'s powerful son [[Atikaya]]. Another son of [[Ravana]], [[Meghanada]] realized that he could not defeat them in direct combat. He was skilled in illusion and magic, performed a powerful [[Yajna]] to increase his magical powers and entered the battlefield. He hid in the clouds and attacked [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] with illusions. He used the extremely powerful [[Brahmastra]] against [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]]. [[Hanuman]] was unharmed by the [[Brahmastra]] since he was blessed by [[Brahmadeva]] himself. All the Vanara warriors and [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] were struck by the power of the astra and fainted and fell on the battlefield, creating a gruesome scene. In the darkness of the night, [[Hanuman]] and [[Vibhishana]] came looking for soldiers, became happy seeing [[Jambavan]] alive.
