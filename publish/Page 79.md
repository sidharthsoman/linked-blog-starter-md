Having crossed the ocean, [[Hanuman]] brought back good news. He gathered his army and, filled with joy, shouted, "I have found [[Sita]]!" He then went to [[Kishkindha]] with his companions and reached [[Prasravana]] Mountain where [[Rama]] was staying. As per [[Rama]]'s request, he gave a detailed account of his journey to [[Lanka]]. When [[Hanuman]] bowed down and [[Rama]] saw the jewellery he was holding, [[Rama]]'s eyes welled up and his heart became heavy. He embraced [[Hanuman]] tightly. Following [[Rama]]'s orders, the Vanara army set out for [[Lanka]] at an auspicious hour and reached the foot of [[Mahendra]] Mountain.
