The first thing they saw on the forest path was [[Bharadwaja]] ashram, after that the [[Chitrakuta]] mountain range. The beautiful and scenic nature soothed their minds. The birds chirped, there was greenery everywhere, beehives swayed in the dense branches of the giant trees. The water from streams and springs flowed freely, a pleasant breeze brought a sense of euphoria everywhere. The peaceful nature cleared the troubled mind. [[Lakshmana]] built a leaf hut using the leaves close to the [[Malyavati]] river bank. He cut down the sturdy parts of the trees and built the walls of the hut. He made it strong enough to withstand the adverse conditions of nature. Rain drops couldn't seep through in the monsoon, strong winds couldn't destroy the roof and cool breeze could flow through during the summer. All three of them started spending their days peacefully and happily in the atmosphere.
