[[Shardula]] ran to [[Ravana]] and informed him about the vast army of Vanaras waiting on the other side of the ocean, while [[Vibhishana]], [[Sugriva]] and [[Hanuman]] were contemplating on how to cross the ocean with the entire army. "One way is to pray to the sea god with devotion and ask for a way. The sea god also has a debt to the [[Ikshvaku]] dynasty," said [[Vibhishana]]. Accordingly, [[Rama]] became meditative. But even after three days, there was no response from the other side. The sea was roaring without stopping. [[Rama]], enraged, threatened with the [[Brahmastra]], saying, "If you don't make way, I will dry up the ocean itself." The waves of the sea, frightened by his roar, receded. The sea god appeared. "[[Rama]]! I am a servant of God. I cannot violate the law. If you build a bridge with the help of [[Nala]], the skilled craftsman in the Vanara army, I can hold it up."
