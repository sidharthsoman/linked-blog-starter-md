There was a wave of joy and excitement among the people as soon as the news broke out. Everyone was happy for [[Rama]]. It was decided that [[Rama]] would be coronated on the auspicious [[Pushya]] muhurtha day, three days from then. The musical instruments resonated. Festoons decorated the city. People cheered everywhere and dressed in new clothes to celebrate. [[Manthara]], the maid servant in the [[Kaikeyi]] palace, heard this noise and commotion. She climbed up to the terrace and saw the enthusiasm of the people but didn't know the reason. She enquired with the other maid servants and found out. She was filled with envy instead of happiness.
