[[Ravana]], who was influenced by his sister, came to [[Maricha]] again. "We demons are being killed by the humans everywhere. We need to teach them a lesson. You must help me kidnap his wife. Take the form of a golden deer and roam around [[Rama]]'s cottage. Tempt [[Sita]]. When [[Rama]] chases after the illusionary deer, I will kidnap [[Sita]], who is alone here," said [[Ravana]]. Not only that, he threatened to behead him if he did not agree. [[Maricha]], who thought it was better to die at the hands of [[Rama]]'s arrow than at the hands of [[Ravana]], agreed to the plan.
