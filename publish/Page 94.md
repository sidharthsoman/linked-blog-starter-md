Even though the sun had set, there was no respite from the war. The battle continued even in the darkness of the night. Shouting "Hey Vanara! Hey demon!" both sides fought and attacked each other. [[Angada]] had greatly troubled [[Ravana]]'s son [[Meghanada]]. [[Meghanada]] was an expert in illusion and magic. He had received a boon from [[Brahma]] and had even defeated [[Indra]] in battle. Therefore, he had another name, [[Indrajit]]. When he used the [[Nagastra]], both [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] were affected by its power and fell unconscious. The Vanara army was lost and confused. Seeing the two lying on the ground, [[Indrajit]], overjoyed, rushed to [[Ravana]], and announced, "[[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] are both dead." [[Ravana]], pleased, hugged and praised the brave warrior.
