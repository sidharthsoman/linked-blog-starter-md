Sage Valmiki's ashram was on the banks of Tamasa River. One day, he went to take a bath in the river. As he reached the banks of the river, he noticed a pair of herons engrossed in love in a tree. At the same time, a hunter who was hiding there shot an arrow at the birds. The arrow hit the male bird, which fluttered in pain, screeched, fell down and died and the female bird cried. The sage, who was deeply thinking about the story of Rama and Sita, saw this sudden tragedy before his eyes and was filled with grief. He cursed the hunter: "Oh hunter, may you be cursed with a short life for killing one of a pair of love-stricken birds."

[Page 2] 
As soon as this curse came from his mouth, the maharishi was grief-stricken for the dead bird, felt sorry for the bird that was going to be lonely. He also felt sorry for having cursed the hunter. Brahmadeva appeared when he was grieving and consoled the maharishi. The curse you have spoken is in the form of a verse. Write a poem about Rama and Sita in a similar way, he suggested. He also gave a boon that the inner and outer nature of every character in the Ramayana poem and every event appear before him as if it is happening right in front of him. Thus it is said that Valmiki maharishi composed the Ramayana with his creativity and the help of Brahmadeva's boon.

[Page 3] Narada muni also inspired the Ramayana story. When Valmiki maharishi met Narada, he said, "Tell me about an exemplary individual in the world, who is full of good qualities and virtues." In turn, Narada briefly mentioned the noble life of Rama. It was his story that later blossomed in Valmiki maharishi and became the Ramayana poem. Valmiki's epic poem is divided into Balakanda, Ayodhya kanda, Aranya kanda, Kishkinda kanda, Sundara kanda and Yuddha kanda.

[Page 4]
Valmiki maharishi taught Ramayana, the epic, to Rama's children Lava and Kusha. These children sang the epic and made it popular. This epic, created by Valmiki Maharishi, has remained firmly rooted in the hearts of the people of Bharat from then to now. It has inspired hundreds of types of creations, art forms, and artifacts, such as plays, dances, music, stories, novels, films, and sculptures. The Ramayana epic is available in almost all Bharateeya languages, as well as in all the languages of the world. It has gained recognition as a national epic in many countries. The great epic Ramayana received Brahmadeva's blessing that this epic will stay on earth as long as the sun and moon exist.

[Page 5]
Kosala was the land blessed where the Sarayu River flows. The capital of that vast kingdom was Ayodhya, which seemed impossible for enemies to conquer. It was built by the legendary emperor, Manu of the Surya dynasty. There were many famous kings in the lineage like Ikshvaku, Pruthu, Dudumara, Mandhaata, Ambarisha, Satyavrata, Harischandra, Sagara, Dilipa, Bhagiratha and Raghu. Among the other famous kings of that lineage was Aja. His son was Dasharatha. He had three queens Kausalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi. They had everything they could imagine but lacked in one thing. Even though they had grown old, King Dasharatha and his queens did not have children yet. The sadness of the king touched the heart of Vasishtha.

[Page 6]
Vasishtha called Rishyashringa, son of Vibhandaka Muni, and asked him to perform Putrakameshti Yajna for King Dasharatha. Putrakameshti is a ritual performed to wish for children. Dasharatha performed the ritual with such devotion that at the end of the ritual, a divine-looking yajnapurusha appeared in the fire of the yajna kunda and gave Dasharatha a pot of divine payasam. Dasharatha shared it with his three wives. Due to the divine payasam, the three queens became pregnant. Kausalya gave birth to Rama, Kaikeyi to Bharata, and Sumitra to Lakshmana and Shatrughna. The children's faces had a divine glow. The people of the kingdom were eager to see the princes. On the other hand, the servants in the palace fought joyfully among themselves to take care of the princes in the way of bathing them, dressing them up, singing them lullabies if they were sleepy and to shower them with love when they woke up.

[Page 7]
Maharishi Vasishtha trained the four princes in weaponry and scriptures. He raised them to be virtuous and valiant. When the princes turned sixteen, the sage Vishwamitra visited Dasharatha's court. After receiving a warm welcome from King Dasharatha, he said painfully, "Oh mighty king, the demons have wreaked havoc in our lives. They disrupt all our yajnas. There is no one who can stop them. Could you please send your son, Rama, to help me put an end to this?" Though Dasharatha was initially hesitant due to his love for Rama, he heeded Vasishtha's advice and entrusted Rama to Vishwamitra. Lakshmana also accompanied his elder brother.

[Page 8]
Vishwamitra showed Rama and Lakshmana all the wonders of nature. He lovingly told them the stories of Rama's ancestors as they crossed the Sarayu river. He taught Rama the powerful mantra "bala ati bala", meaning 'strength upon strength'. As they entered the Malada-Karoosha forest, the fearsome demon Tataka attacked them. She pointed at the princes and asked Vishwamitra, "Who are these infants that you have brought? Their meat won't even be enough for a single meal." She looked at the boys and yelled, "Just wait and watch how I peel them like a banana and then I will eat you up in just one bite." She leaped into action and sprang towards them. Without missing a beat, Rama pierced her with a sharp arrow and ended her.

[Page 9]
Vishwamitra started performing the rituals of the yajna after reaching Siddhashrama. The task of guarding the yajnashala fell upon Rama and Lakshmana. On the sixth day, Tataka's sons, Subahu and Maricha, along with their demon army, unexpectedly appeared in the sky to attack the yajnashala. They roared and prepared to shower the sacrificial fire with flesh and blood. Rama saw this and immediately acted. He used the Manavastra on Maricha, which sent him flying a hundred yojanas away. Rama used the Agneyastra, which killed Subahu. The entire demon army was terrified of Rama and Lakshmana. Thus the yajna was completed without any obstacles. Later, Vishwamitra, along with the two brave boys, set out for Mithila.

[Page 10]
They stopped at Gautama muni's ashrama on the way to Mithila. Gautama muni's wife, Ahalya, had been cursed and turned into stone. As soon as Rama entered the ashram, Ahalya's curse broke and she regained her consciousness. The two princes bowed down and touched her feet. After receiving Gautama and Ahalya's blessings, the princes, along with Kaushika, set out for the court of King Janaka.

[Page 11]
Mithila was the capital of the Videha kingdom. Nimi's descendant, Siradhwaja, was the king there. Janaka was his other name. While Janaka was plowing the earth, a divine child was found at the tip of the plough. Believing it to be a divine blessing, Janaka adopted the daughter. She was called Janaki. She was also called Vaidehi since she was the princess of Videha, and she was called Maithili since she was the child of Mithila. When she came of age, he decided to give her in marriage to a suitable groom. He organized a swayamvara. He declared Sita's marriage with the challenge of Shiva Dhanush, which was blessed to his lineage by Maheshwara. Princes from faraway lands came, but none were able to even lift the Shiva Dhanush, let alone string it.

[Page 12]
As soon as King Janaka found out that sage Vishwamitra was arriving at his palace, he reached the main entrance to welcome the sage with respect. The king touched the sage's feet and sought his blessings. Janaka was happy as soon as Vishwamitra informed that Rama was interested to see the Shiva Dhanush. The Shiva Dhanush was brought to them on an eight-wheeled chariot. As per Vishwamitra's words, Rama lifted the bow as if it were made of flowers and strung the divine bow and twanged the string. The bow broke with a tremendous sound. The people of Mithila were amazed. Janaka was delighted and he got his daughter Sita married to Rama. The people of Ayodhya arrived in Mithila. Sita was married to Rama. Janaka's daughter Urmila was married to Lakshmana. Janaka's younger brother Kushadhwaja's daughters Mandavi and Shrutakirti were married to Bharata and Shatrughna respectively. After the wedding ceremony was performed auspiciously, Vishwamitra went towards the Himalaya. Rama and Lakshmana started for Ayodhya. Bharata and Shatrughna with their wives were called by Bharata's maternal uncle Yudhajit to Kekaya.

[Page 13]
Twelve years had passed since the swayamvara. Rama and Sita had a harmonious marriage. The people of Ayodhya had immense affection for Rama. Rama was the embodiment of love for King Dasharatha. Realizing that old age had caught up with him, Dasharatha decided to crown Rama as the king. He called upon the scholars, elders, and ministers and expressed his desire. "Rama is a treasure trove of good qualities. He understands dharma. He is soft-spoken, brave, and truthful. He is also very generous. Nobody can match his humbleness, love, and affection he shows to the citizens. He is smart and is an expert in everything. He is fit to be the king of the noble kingdom," he said. Everyone agreed that Rama was fit to be the king in all respects.

[Page 14]
There was a wave of joy and excitement among the people as soon as the news broke out. Everyone was happy for Rama. It was decided that Rama would be coronated on the auspicious Pushya muhurtha day, three days from then. The musical instruments resonated. Festoons decorated the city. People cheered everywhere and dressed in new clothes to celebrate. Manthara, the maid servant in the Kaikeyi palace, heard this noise and commotion. She climbed up to the terrace and saw the enthusiasm of the people but didn't know the reason. She enquired with the other maid servants and found out. She was filled with envy instead of happiness.

[Page 15]
The hunchbacked Manthara ran to Kaikeyi immediately. Manthara told Kaikeyi that people would praise Rama and forget Bharata. She added that Kaikeyi would never become a Rajamata and that title would go to Kausalya, and she would be like a maid to Kausalya. She constantly repeated the same thing and changed Kaikeyi's perception towards Rama. Kaikeyi, who loved Rama like her own son, was now filled with envy. "You were given two boons by King Dasharatha. This is the right moment to ask for it. Make Rama go to the forest in exile for fourteen years and ask for Bharata to become the king," Manthara said to Kaikeyi.

[Page 16]
Manthara was alert when she found out that Dasharatha was on his way to meet Kaikeyi. "Your old husband will act as if he is heartbroken when you ask him to fulfill his promises. He may even beg you to reconsider. Don't listen to anything he has to say," she trained Kaikeyi. Dasharatha found Kaikeyi distressed when he visited her that night. Her eyes were filled with anger and all jewelry was strewn across the floor. Kaikeyi stopped Dasharatha from consoling her and instead blurted all that was told to her by Manthara. Dasharatha was stunned to hear her conditions. He pleaded with Kaikeyi to reconsider, but she was adamant. He was bound by his promises and could not refuse her demands. He cried but to no avail. Kaikeyi remained unmoved.

[Page 17]
Ayodhya was ready before the sun even rose for coronation. Rama and Sita had fasted, slept on the floor as a part of the rituals. They bathed and wore new clothes. "Rule the kingdom in such a way that even the poorest person receives justice," blessed sage Vasishtha. Sumantra brought Rama before Dasharatha as per Kaikeyi's order. As soon as Dasharatha saw Rama's face, he was overcome with grief. He couldn't speak. He hugged Rama tightly and cried. His tears drenched Rama's shoulders. He fainted again. Rama asked Kaikeyi about the reason. Kaikeyi, devoid of any compassion, narrated the entire incident. "Dasharatha, under the influence of anger, had granted two boons to me. Now those boons were destined to fulfill my wishes. As per the books, Bharata would be crowned as the king and Rama would have to go to the forest for fourteen years. To fulfill his promises, Rama had to leave for the forest immediately," she said harshly.

[Page 18]
Rama's face remained calm. "There is no greater virtue than obeying a father's words. Look, I am leaving for the forest right now. Let Bharata be the king. May he rule the kingdom with love for the people and uphold righteousness," said Rama. He then took blessings of both Dasharatha and Kaikeyi and left for the forest. Lakshmana was furious on hearing this. He couldn't bear the injustice his brother was facing. He was ready to revolt against Kaikeyi and Bharata. He argued angrily that Kaikeyi's demands were unfair. However, Rama stopped Lakshmana. He reminded him that it was their duty to obey their father's commands, no matter how painful they might be. He stated that they must respect Kaikeyi's wishes. Rama's words calmed down Lakshmana and he decided to accompany Rama to the forest. Sita too expressed her desire to accompany Rama to the forest. She stated that she as his wife couldn't leave him alone in such difficult times. She followed him to the forest.

[Page 19]
Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita climbed onto the chariot and were preparing themselves to live in the forest by changing into simple clothes. Sumantra drove the chariot. The people of Ayodhya were celebrating the previous day. Today they were submerged in an ocean of shock. There was anger everywhere. The citizens followed the chariot as it moved forward. So did the royal retinue.

"We will accompany you to the forest. We don't want to live in a city where Rama is not there," they said. None of this commotion seemed to affect Rama. His face still had the same calmness and seriousness. He promised them that he would return as soon as the exile was completed.

[Page 20]
As the chariot carrying Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita crossed the Tamasa river, it was nightfall. On a palanquin made of leaves, Rama and Sita were to sleep. Lakshmana, who had been awake all night, kept guard. The crowd that had followed them from Ayodhya dispersed in all directions to rest. Before dawn, Rama started the chariot again. The chariot moved north, south, and again north to deliberately confuse the people and then disappeared from sight. When the people woke up and rubbed their eyes, they saw the marks of the chariot wheels and were unsure with regards to the direction it had gone. Lost and without a way, they all eventually returned to Ayodhya.

[Page 21]
This time the chariot touched Shringiberapur on the banks of Ganga. The one who ruled the province was Guha, the king of Nishada tribe, who was a friend of Rama. Guha, who had heard the news of Rama's arrival, had already started preparing for the hospitality of the guests. He ordered the preparation of various kinds of food. But Rama, who had become an ascetic during his exile, had taken a vow to eat nothing but fruits and berries found in the forest. Therefore, he politely refused the royal meal offered by Guha. "Please don't feel bad. Our hearts are filled with the love you showed us today. Please help us by giving us a boat for the journey ahead," Rama requested. Guha accepted even though he was upset about the developments. He was happy to be of service to them in any way possible. They spent the night on the banks of the Ganga and prepared for the next day's journey. A nice boat was also made ready by Guha for Rama's journey.

[Page 22]
Rama prepared to cross the river Ganga by that boat. Since the border of Ayodhya ended there, the exile had officially begun. Sumantra, who had to bid him farewell and return to Ayodhya, felt as if he was drowning in a well of sorrow. Rama consoled him and said, "Tell Dasharatha that we are safe. We will come to Ayodhya as soon as the period of exile is over, without a moment's delay." The chariot had been turned around facing Ayodhya. The chariot had begun its journey to the kingdom without its king.

[Page 23]
Guha brought banyan tree sap for Rama and Lakshmana to tie their hair. Sita got into the boat first, then Rama followed, chanting a hymn. He bowed to the Ganga. Sita, sitting in the boat, bowed to the Ganga and said, "Oh Ganga, with your grace may Rama return to Ayodhya with me and his brother Lakshmana." The boat sailed crossing the vast Ganga and reached the southern bank. After crossing the river and reaching the bank, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita entered the forest. They had reached an important stage of their exile in the forest. In the front was Lakshmana, followed by Sita and Rama in the end. Rama hadn't gotten upset when he was asked to go on exile, neither was he sad when he had left his mother behind or give up the kingdom, but he was heartbroken when he saw Sita scared while entering the forest. He kept silent thinking about the distress she was going through.

[Page 24]
The first thing they saw on the forest path was Bharadwaja ashram, after that the Chitrakuta mountain range. The beautiful and scenic nature soothed their minds. The birds chirped, there was greenery everywhere, beehives swayed in the dense branches of the giant trees. The water from streams and springs flowed freely, a pleasant breeze brought a sense of euphoria everywhere. The peaceful nature cleared the troubled mind. Lakshmana built a leaf hut using the leaves close to the Malyavati river bank. He cut down the sturdy parts of the trees and built the walls of the hut. He made it strong enough to withstand the adverse conditions of nature. Rain drops couldn't seep through in the monsoon, strong winds couldn't destroy the roof and cool breeze could flow through during the summer. All three of them started spending their days peacefully and happily in the atmosphere.

[Page 25]
Dasharatha was heartbroken by Rama's separation. He was unable to bear the sight of Kaikeyi's face. He cried day and night. He shed tears remembering Rama. "Kausalya, my death is near. If my son Rama comes back, all my sorrows will disappear. Tell me, Kausalya, will he come? Will he come and comfort me?" he cried like a child. It was already evening when Sumantra returned to Ayodhya. He grieved the departure of Rama. He didn't want to meet anyone and wanted some solitude but he had to do his duty. He had to report to the king Dasharatha that Rama had begun his exile in the forest. He went to Queen Kausalya's palace. He found Dasharatha in a sorry state. His eyes had puffed up from crying and his voice had become hoarse. Only his lips moved while repeatedly saying "Rama". When he heard that Rama had not returned, he yelled, "Rama, Rama" and fell unconscious.

[Page 26]
It had been five days since Rama had begun his exile. The sun rose as usual but the king of Surya vansha didn't. Dasharatha died of grief. Kausalya and Sumitra were also present, but they had fainted from grief at the time of Dasharatha's death. The entire kingdom wept upon hearing the news of Dasharatha's death. The fate of Ayodhya had turned upside down. The people blamed evil Kaikeyi for this. Sage Vasishtha visited the palace upon hearing the bad news. He consoled everyone and asked Bharata and Shatrughna to return from Kaikeyi's father's home. The sage then ordered for the earthly remains of the king to be preserved till the princes returned.

Done

[Page 27]
Bharata and Shatrughna rushed back immediately. They felt something was wrong the moment they entered Ayodhya. They felt as if they had entered an abandoned city. Dasharatha's palace felt empty. Bharata inquired with Kaikeyi. She explained everything that happened to Bharata. Her tone suggested that she was proud of what she had done and she said it as if she wanted to say "I did all this for you". Bharata was distraught and angry. "Are you a mother? Definitely not, you are a demon. You destroyed our beautiful family, an enemy in the form of a mother. You killed your husband. Go jump into the fire or hang yourself. I have nothing to do with you," Bharata cursed with anger. On one hand, the grief of losing his father, then sorrow of his brother being far away and on the other the pain of being called a cruel, evil and demonic person by the world. Bharata's mind was agitated. He went to see Kausalya.

[Page 28]
Kausalya who saw Bharata entering her inner palace, could not control her anger. Her words flowed out without control. Kausalya cursed Bharata, calling him a cunning and greedy person who desired the kingdom. Bharata who had never heard such harsh words from her was stunned. He fell to the ground, and begged for her forgiveness. He said, "Mother, I have no part in my mother's evil deeds. It was she who desired the kingdom, not me."

"How can I live happily after sending Rama to the forest? What is the use of a kingdom without him? What is the point of becoming an emperor in a land without my brother? If I am guilty then let all the evils of the world befall me." Realizing his pure heart, Kausalya came back to reality, controlled her anger and hugged the innocent Bharata in her lap. She comforted him, comforting herself as well.

[Page 29]
All the rituals of Dasharatha's death were over. Sage Vasishtha along with other ministers decided to conduct the coronation of Bharata. He strongly objected to their decision. "I will go to the forest and bring Rama back to Ayodhya. Only he is eligible to succeed our father," he said and left for Chitrakuta with all the elders. The noise of the group's chatter frightened the peaceful animals and birds of the surroundings. Lakshmana who was guarding Rama felt a sense of danger after hearing the commotion. He looked around and saw Bharata's army approaching. He thought that this army must have come to kill Rama and became enraged. "Look at this brother! Bharata has lost his mind because of the power and has come here to kill you along with his army. I will destroy this army," he roared.

[Page 30]
Rama laughed at Lakshmana. "Our Bharata is not like that. He would never kill brothers for the throne. Please calm down," he said. Bharata who came to Chitrakuta, saw Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He then bowed down to his elder brother and his sister-in-law and informed them about the death of King Dasharatha. The flood gates in Rama's heart opened when he heard the news that his father had died. Sita and Lakshmana were equally in pain. Rama and Lakshmana conducted the final ritual at sunset under the guidance of Vasishtha. Bharata later pleaded with Rama to abandon the vow of exile and return to Ayodhya. He pleaded in various ways but all his pleas went in vain. Rama's determination to fulfill his father's words was not shaken even a bit by Bharata's tears. Helpless to make his brother return to Ayodhya, Bharata placed darba grass on the ground and proceeded to end his life.

[Page 31]
Guru Vasishtha realized that the situation was taking a dark turn and gave Rama the golden sandals he had brought from Ayodhya. Rama, understanding his intentions, touched them with his feet and returned them. Bharata, placing the sandals on his head, said "Brother, if I do not see you by the time fourteen years exile is over, I will enter the fire." Bharata installed the sandals touched by Rama's feet on the throne of Ayodhya. He also took a vow of vanavasa like Rama, wore matted hair and lived in Nandigrama outside Ayodhya. He did not become the king. He considered Rama the king of Ayodhya and himself as his representative.

[Page 32]
As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana proceeded from Chitrakuta, they met the sage Atri at his ashram. The sage's wife was delighted upon their arrival. She adorned Sita with ornaments and felt blessed to see her in such a divine form. Sage Atri then showed them the way to Dandakaranya. Upon arrival, a fierce and terrible demon appeared on the way. He stood blocking the way and tried to abduct Sita. He threatened and roared. Rama and Lakshmana subdued the demon with sharp arrows. They cut off his arms that had touched Sita and threw them away. The demon, burning and suffering with remorse, said that his name was Viradha and that he had become a demon due to Kubera's curse. He begged them to cremate his body so that his curse would be lifted. Rama and Lakshmana cremated him which lifted Viradha's curse.

[Page 33]
From there Rama, Lakshmana and Sita came across the ashramas of many sages. They met Sharabhanga maharishi. He was chanting the Ramataraka mantra and was waiting to meet Rama. Happy to have met Rama, he attained moksha. The trio moved ahead and reached Sutikshna muni's ashram. Sutikshna said, "Dandakaranya is a land of penance. Meet all the sages here and receive their blessings. Enjoy the beauty of nature here for days." Following his suggestion, Rama spent ten years of his exile meeting sages and enjoying the beauty of nature.

[Page 34]
They moved ahead and reached Sage Agastya's ashram which was on the banks of the Godavari river. Agastya welcomed them and gave them a bow made by Vishwakarma, Brahmastra, two inexhaustible quivers and a divine sword. He suggested that the area around Panchavati on the banks of the Godavari River would be suitable for their stay.

[Page 35]
The three of them continued walking towards the direction pointed by Maharishi Agastya. Sita then decided to ask Rama, "Since you have sacrificed the throne and live as an austere, why do you kill the demons? Isn't that against the principles of austere?" Rama replied calmly, "Just like it is the dharma of fire to burn, it is the Kshatriya's dharma to destroy evil. We don't need the throne for doing our duty." As they traveled further into the forest, they saw a large bird sitting on a branch of a huge tree. Rama became fully alert, thinking it was some kind of demon. Then the bird said, "Oh Rama, don't kill me, I am your father's friend. My name is Jatayu. My father is Aruna, my mother is Shyeni and Sampati is my elder brother. The atrocities of cruel demons are rampant in this forest. Whenever you and your brother leave the cottage, I will protect Sita." Rama was grateful to Jatayu.

[Page 36]
The banks of Godavari were laced with beautiful trees that bore a variety of fruits and flowers that emanated a lovely scent. There was greenery as far as the eyes could see. The sweet water of the Godavari river quenched thirst. Nothing came close to the beauty of the sunrise they witnessed there. Animals like deer, rabbits and peacocks could be found roaming around there. They could spend the whole day listening to the birds chirp. The fog in the early morning gave it a mystic feel and the stars that littered the night sky mesmerized them. They had decided this was the perfect place for them to build a hut. They built a leaf hut with mud walls and a roof made of Shami tree branches, and built windows for the breeze to flow in. Sita decorated the hut diligently. They started to live peacefully.

[Page 37]
The thirteen years of forest life of Rama was about to end in the pleasant environment of Panchavati. One afternoon in the month of Margashira, an old she-demon with a hefty and ugly body suddenly jumped into the area in front of the cottage of Rama and laughed derisively. She was Shurpanakha, the sister of Ravana. She was fascinated by the handsome and graceful personality of Rama.

She narrated the history of Ravana, Kumbhakarna, and Vibhishana. She said Khara and Dushana who are ruling over this forest were her brothers. Rama too narrated his whole story as it was. Shurpanakha pleaded, became obstinate and said, "I am capable of taking any shape I desire. The whole of this Dandakaranya is in my custody. You must marry me."

[Page 38]
Dasharatha's son first tried to calmly explain things to Shurpanakha. However, her sole desire was to have Rama as her husband. Rama rejected her advances politely by saying that he had taken a vow to be married only to one woman. Shurpanakha's attention shifted to Sita. "You want to be married only to one woman? That can be arranged. I will kill Sita and marry you. Your vow will not be broken," she declared. "I will marry you at any cost," she proclaimed and pounced on Sita. Rama instantly signaled to his brother Lakshmana. Before the rakshasi could attack Sita and cause harm, Saumitri's sharp sword flashed and cut off Shurpanakha's nose and ears. Blood oozed out. "Evil demon, I never attack a woman. Learn your lesson and leave this instant," Lakshmana said. Howling in pain and humiliation, that demoness disappeared into the darkness of the forest.

[Page 39]
With blood flowing from her nose and ears, Shurpanakha cried and wailed. She ran to Khara, Dushana and Trishira, roaring in grief and anger. She hid her mistake and exaggerated Lakshmana's cruelty and urged the other rakshasas to attack Rama and Lakshmana. The rakshasas, lacking in wisdom, were easily provoked by her cries. Incited by her, fourteen thousand rakshasas marched toward Rama. But Rama's arrows proved to be deadly. The demons didn't even make him sweat. They were all killed one by one. Shurpanakha who was hiding behind a tree and watching this was left clueless.

[Page 40]
Rama had vanquished many rakshasas in Dandakaranya but only one remained. He was Akampana. He immediately went to Lanka and reported to Ravana, the king of rakshasas. He told Ravana that Sita was Rama's life, and if he abducted her, Rama would die of grief. Hearing this, Ravana, who was already blinded with desire for Sita, immediately flew in his chariot to Maricha's ashram. He asked Maricha to help him abduct Sita. However, Maricha, who had already experienced Rama's power, refused. When Ravana heard about Rama's bravery, he gave up the idea of abducting Sita and returned to Lanka.

[Page 41]
Vishravasu was the son of Pulastya, one of the manasa putra of Brahmadeva. Ravana was the son of Vishravasu and a rakshasa woman Kaikasi. The king of Lanka, Ravana, the lord of the three worlds, renowned for his might and prowess, who could bend even the Gods to his will, who could grow ten heads and twenty arms if he wished - a powerful being was untouched by the fear of death. This kind of power had rightly given birth to arrogance in him. As he was proudly conducting his court, adorned with all his ornaments, his sister Shurpanakha approached him. Looking even more ferocious than usual, she entered, wailing, tearing at her clothes, and rolling on the ground. In various ways, she tried to incite her brother. "For your sake, I went to bring Sita, the beautiful wife of Rama. But he insulted me, cutting off my nose and ears," she said. She repeatedly described Sita's beauty, hoping to inflame his desire. But Rama's rejection was the ultimate insult, exceeding any physical injury. It was the fire that ignited Ravana's passion.

[Page 42]
Ravana, who was influenced by his sister, came to Maricha again. "We demons are being killed by the humans everywhere. We need to teach them a lesson. You must help me kidnap his wife. Take the form of a golden deer and roam around Rama's cottage. Tempt Sita. When Rama chases after the illusionary deer, I will kidnap Sita, who is alone here," said Ravana. Not only that, he threatened to behead him if he did not agree. Maricha, who thought it was better to die at the hands of Rama's arrow than at the hands of Ravana, agreed to the plan.

[Page 43]
Maricha who could assume any desired form assumed the form of a magical golden deer, arrived in the banana grove next to Rama's hut. It danced and pranced in various ways, catching Sita's eye. Seeing emeralds, and hooves like diamonds, Sita's resolute mind faltered. She wanted this deer at any cost. She pestered her husband Rama to bring her the golden deer.

Ignoring Lakshmana's suspicion that this might be a demon's illusion, Rama went after the deer. The deer gave Rama a tough time. It galloped and changed directions making it difficult to be captured. On one hand, Rama was determined to catch this deer. On the other hand, the deer, which had planned to lure Rama far away from cottage, was leaping further and further away.

[Page 44]
Maricha's maya mruga greatly troubled Rama. When he was certain that it was impossible to capture it alive, Rama shot an arrow. It pierced Maricha's heart. While dying, Maricha mimicked Rama's voice and cried out, "Oh Sita, oh Lakshmana" and fell to the ground. Hearing this cry, Sita, fearing that Rama himself was in trouble asked Lakshmana to go and see him. When Lakshmana said that this was all the work of rakshasas, Sita became furious. She insulted Lakshmana with abusive words. Hurt by this, Lakshmana with a heavy heart, picked up his bow and arrows and ran towards the source of Rama's cry, disappearing into the darkness of the forest.

[Page 45]
Now Sita was alone in the cottage. Ravana, who had been waiting for such an opportunity, disguised himself as a sage and came to the ashram gate, chanting hymns. As per custom, Sita received him and offered him hospitality. Engaging in idle talk, Ravana kept stealing glances at her beauty. Finally, revealing his identity, he lunged at her. He grabbed her hair and dragged her towards his chariot. He flew away in his aerial chariot, pushing her inside. Seeing this deception, Sita cried out in helplessness.

[Page 46]
Seeing this sight, Jatayu immediately chased Ravana's chariot. He destroyed Ravana's bow and arrow, his crown, and the flagstaff. A fierce battle ensued in the sky. But how could Jatayu's righteous strength stand up to Ravana's demonical power? His strength waned. His body grew weary.

Ravana's sword severed Jatayu's vast wings and legs. The weakened king of birds finally fell from the sky to the earth. Roaring in pain, Sita raised a ruckus. Gagging her, Ravana seized her by the neck and flew swiftly towards Lanka in his aerial chariot.

[Page 47]
Ravana took Sita to Lanka and kept her in a splendid palace. He displayed his luxurious life to her, showed her his military power, and demanded her to marry him. But Sita would not listen to him. "My husband Rama will come and destroy Lanka. You will die a gruesome death," she declared in a firm voice. Ravana enraged confined her to the Ashoka grove and assigned a group of fierce rakshasis to guard her. He gave her a deadline to marry him within twelve months.

[Page 48]
Rama having killed Maricha, was returning to their ashram. Lakshmana, who had gone out to look for Rama, met him and explained how Sita had yelled at him and sent him in search of Rama. Maricha taking the form of golden deer just to lure Rama away and calling out for help in Rama's voice before dying gave birth to suspicions. Sensing danger, both rushed back to the ashram. They were stunned to see the ashram was empty. Sita was nowhere to be found. Searching frantically for her around the forest, in the mountains, and by the rivers, Rama cried out in anguish, "Sita, where are you?" Lakshmana comforted his grief-stricken brother.

[Page 49]
Filled with anxiety, they went further and saw Jatayu lying on the ground facing the sky. He was still breathing. Seeing Rama, Jatayu was overcome with grief and joy at the same time. He spoke in a faltering voice, telling them what had happened. "Ravana abducted Sita and flew south. He is the son of Vishravasu," he said. These were his last words. He had held onto his life waiting for Rama. Rama, filled with grief, performed the last rites for Jatayu.

[Page 50]
Rama and Lakshmana started south. Then, long arms appeared out of nowhere and grasped them. When they looked, it was a strange figure. There was no head, but a mouth in the stomach, teeth inside the mouth, one eye in the chest, with fire in it. Rama and Lakshmana cut off the arms of this strange figure. Immediately, the form was liberated from the curse. He now began to tell his story. He was Kabandha, a rakshasa. Due to the curses of Indra and a sage, he had gotten this bad form. He was blessed with liberation from the curse by Rama. As soon as Kabandha's body was burnt as per his request, he got a divine body. He stood in the sky and said "O Rama and Lakshmana, go to the banks of the Pampa. Meet Sugriva in the Rishyamukha Giri. Rama, Shabari is waiting for you in the Matanga ashram." He disappeared after giving the advice.

[Page 51]
Following Kabandha's words, Rama and Lakshmana left for the Pampa region. There they met Shabari, an old woman and a disciple of Matanga Muni, at the Matanga ashram. Following the instructions of Matanga, Shabari had been keeping herself alive just to meet Rama. Her guru had told her that she would attain salvation by seeing Rama. Believing that Rama would come, Shabari had collected fruits and berries with great devotion and love. She offered them all to Rama with motherly affection. With Rama's consent, Shabari decided to leave for the heavenly abode. She entered a fire and went to heaven as a divine being.

[Page 52]
The brothers Rama and Lakshmana advanced toward the Rishyamuka mountain while looking at the beauty of the Pampa Lake. Sugriva, who was sitting with his people, grew curious about these two divine figures. He sent his minister Hanuman to find out who they were, as he suspected they might be from Vali, his elder brother who was trying to kill him. Hanuman's father is Kesari, the king of Vanaras. He was born to Anjana Devi by the grace of god Vayu. Hanuman, also known as Pavana Putra and Anjaneya, was a shape shifter. He went to Rama and Lakshmana disguised as a monk. He introduced himself and asked about Rama. Rama was impressed by Hanuman's eloquence. As soon as he saw Rama's noble and righteous personality, Hanuman developed a sense of devotion towards him. The two of them got closer to each other with mutual respect, as if they were old friends.

[Page 53]
Hanuman took his real form and said, "Rama, I am the main advisor to Vanara chief Sugriva. He is in trouble. His elder brother Vali has banished him from Kishkinda and has abducted his wife too. We are living in Rishyamukha mountains in exile. Sugriva is humble, trustworthy and honest.

He will definitely help you if you develop friendship with him. Our problems are similar in nature. Please follow me. Sugriva can be a big help in your search for Sita Mata." He then carried them on his shoulders and took them to Sugriva.

[Page 54]
Hanuman explained Rama's story to Sugriva. Rama and Sugriva, who were suffering equally, shook hands with each other. Rama embraced Sugriva deeply and vowed to be friends forever. Rama swore that he would kill Vali and Sugriva swore that he would help find Sita. Both Rama and Sugriva put their hands in the fire lit by Hanuman, and took an oath to share their happiness and sorrows. "Long back, Rishi Matanga had cursed Vali that he would die if he stepped on the Rishyamukha mountains. His curse turned into a boon for me. I hid here when he chased me. He knows that I am here but he can't do anything about it. Please kill Vali and help me. His kingdom will be mine along with the complete Vanara army," Sugriva explained his predicament. Rama promised to kill Vali.

[Page 55]
A few days ago in Rishyamukha, Sugriva and others witnessed a strange incident. A wicked man was flying through the sky, carrying away a young woman. She was screaming and struggling, calling out "Rama, Lakshmana". It was clear that it was an abduction.

Seeing them from below, the woman tied her ornaments in her cloth and threw them down. When Guha brought back the bundle of ornaments that had been carefully kept inside the cave and showed them to Rama, he was heartbroken. He cried, his throat choked with sobs, his eyes blurred.

[Page 56]
Kishkindha was the kingdom of Vanaras. Vali was the king. Sugriva, on Rama's advice, went to Kishkindha and challenged Vali to a duel. Both fought fiercely. The earth shook and sent boulders flying. They seemed evenly matched, neither gaining the upper hand.

Since both looked alike, Rama had tied a necklace around Sugriva's neck to distinguish him. Rama who was hiding in a nearby cave, waited for the right moment to intervene. When the fight reached its peak, Rama shot an arrow from his bow. The arrow pierced Vali's chest, mortally wounding him.



[Page 57]
Vali, the brave warrior, fell dead. Tara, his wife fell upon his body and wept. "Who will protect me and Angada now?" she cried. Rama comforted her saying, "Angada will become the prince. No one can escape destiny, and a brave woman does not grieve." Tara's sorrow subsided upon hearing Rama's words.

Sugriva felt guilty. Lakshmana consoled him. Sugriva performed the last rites for Vali according to custom, with Angada by his side. Angada took his father's dead body by a chariot to the Pampa River. All the Vanaras were present there and the final rites were performed.

[Page 58]
Sugriva was crowned as the king of Kishkindha. Now, the task of finding Sita remained. It was still the rainy season. Rama and Sugriva came to a consent that the search should begin after the rainy season, once the month of Karthika started. However, even after many days had passed since the rainy season ended, he did not pay any heed to the promise he had made to Rama. He completely ignored the promise and reveled in the luxurious life of the Kishkindha palace. This angered Rama. Lakshmana who came to remind Sugriva of Rama's words, warned him angrily, saying, "If you are not ready to start the search for Sita, be prepared to fight." Sugriva was stunned. Tara tried to pacify Lakshmana's anger. She explained that they had already sent the Vanara warriors for the search. Sugriva also apologized for his mistake.

[Page 59]
All the Vanara warriors assembled in Kishkindha. Sugriva commanded that anyone who did not arrive back with news within ten days would be sentenced to death. They were divided into four teams and sent in four directions to search for Sita. Angada, Nala, Nila, Jambavanta, Gavaya, Gavaksha, Mainda, Dwivida and many more Vanara warriors were selected for the special task.

But Rama had some hope in Hanuman. He had immense faith that Hanuman would succeed. Rama called Hanuman close and placed his signet ring, engraved with his name, in Hanuman's hands, saying "Show this ring to Sita when you find her". Hanuman was proud of the trust Rama had placed in him.

[Page 60]
Sita's search party headed south. The leader of the group was Angada. As the group kept moving forward, they saw the mouth of a cave in the middle of a dense forest. The vanaras noticed that birds were coming out of the cave in large flocks. They guessed that there might be water there and went inside. But there, a big, eye-catching structure stood tall. It was a cave city built by Maya. In that cave city, Swayamprabha, a Yogini, was sitting in a yoga posture. Hanuman approached her and explained all about their journey. She offered food and drinks to all the Vanaras. After they finished eating, she asked the Vanaras to close their eyes tightly. When they opened their eyes, they were no longer in her cave, they were standing in front of a vast blue ocean.

[Page 61]
The vanaras sat stunned, seeing the vast ocean that stretched as far as the eye could see. They sat there clueless. They didn't even know if there was land beyond the ocean. They couldn't return without finding Sita for Sugriva was waiting back there to punish them if they returned empty-handed. Jambavanta looking at their helpless situation suggested they sing Rama's story. He believed a solution would present itself to them if they did so. Angada sang "Jatayu laid down his life to protect Sita. He was a blessed soul who fought the mighty Ravana."

Jatayu's elder brother Sampati who was in a cave in the Mahendra Mountain heard this. Once, Sampati's wings were burnt and charred by the sun when he flew close to it. This had rendered him unable to fly. Hearing about his brother's death, he slowly walked out of the cave and shed tears. The vanaras were stunned looking at his huge stature.

[Page 62]
Sampati approached the vanaras and asked them about the death of his brother, Jatayu. Angada explained the story in brief and informed him that they are in search of Sita. Then Sampati said, "It is true, I saw Ravana take away a young woman. I can see things that happen a hundred yojanas away. There beyond that shore, Sita is imprisoned. Cross the sea and go to Lanka." As he was saying this his wings sprouted back. Sampati who had the boon that his burnt wings would grow back if he helped Rama, was overjoyed by this. "I have done my duty for Rama's work! My wings have come back!" Saying this, Sampati happily flew into the sky and disappeared.

[Page 63]
Sampati got his wings back but what about them? The Vanaras gathered on the banks of the ocean, wondering how to cross it. They just sat there unable to think of any ways to cross the ocean. If any more time was wasted, they would get hungry and that would be the end of their mission. Finally Angada called together all the vanara warriors and asked them for their ideas. He asked them how far they could jump. Gaja and Gavaksha said they could cover twenty yojanas in a single jump. Rishabha said he could jump forty yojanas while Gandhamada said fifty yojanas. Mainda and Dwivida said sixty and seventy yojanas respectively. Tara said he could easily jump eighty yojanas. Old Jambavanta, not realizing his limitations said he could jump 90 yojanas, and Angada said he could fly 100 yojanas, but he's not sure if he can make it back.

[Page 64]
While all this discussion was going on, Hanuman was just sitting silently. Jambavanta, who knew about his true potential, called Hanuman up, "Oh, brave warrior. Why are you sitting there silently? Didn't you hear Sampati give us a clear indication that Sita was in Lanka? You are faster than Garuda. Can't you go there and find out about Sita?" Jambavanta reminded him of all the adventurous things he did as a child. In fact, Hanuman had a curse that if someone didn't remind him of his true powers, he would forget them. So Jambavanta revived Hanuman's memory by reminding him of all his jumping feats. This rekindled the power in Hanuman. He, who was sitting dully, got up with great enthusiasm. As he stood up, he grew bigger and bigger, until he was finally as tall as the sky. The other Vanaras watched this amazing sight with awe and wonder.

[Page 65]
"I will cross this ocean with the blessings of Lord Rama. Chant his name in reverence while I go to Lanka and find out about Sita Mata," said Hanuman. Hanuman grew in size and covered the Mahendra Mountain. The wild animals scattered in fright and the Yakshas ran away in any directions they could. He climbed to the peak and put all the weight of his body on the hill and roared. He bent his knees ready to leap. He prayed to Vayu Deva, channeled all his powers and jumped to the sky in one mighty leap chanting Rama's name. No sooner than Hanuman had begun his journey to Lanka, the Vanaras had begun chanting Rama's name.

[Page 66]
As Hanuman leaped to cross the ocean, the sea creatures were scared and fled. The fish, unable to find shelter, trembled. The ocean, which was already turbulent, danced even more wildly. From within the waves, Mount Mainaka rose. Hanuman gently touched the mountain that had come in his way. Mainaka, who had been helped by Vayu Deva, now felt affection for Hanuman, who was blessed by Vayu Deva. "You are the son of Vayu Deva who once saved me. Helping you is my Dharma. It is very tiring to cross the ocean. Rest here for a while and consume the fruits and then go," said Mainaka. Hanuman replied, "Forgive me, Mainaka. I must finish the task entrusted to me as soon as possible. There is no room for delay now. Thank you for your invitation. I can never get tired while I serve Lord Rama." Without waiting for another moment, he flew on.



[Page 67]
On the way across the ocean, the Gods decided to test Hanuman's character. As part of this, they sent a Naga Mata named Surasa. She rose from the water, appeared before Hanuman, and ordered him, "I have come to eat you. Come to my mouth." Hanuman, who was on his way to find Sita, told her that he couldn't delay and would become her food when he returned. Surasa didn't agree. So, Hanuman said, "Make your mouth big enough for my body." Not knowing Hanuman's cleverness, Surasa opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger, and as her mouth grew bigger, Hanuman suddenly shrunk himself to the size of a thumb and jumped into her mouth and then flew back up into the sky. Surasa, impressed by Hanuman's intelligence, wished him luck for his mission.

[Page 68]
As Hanuman was flying through the sky, he felt his body being pulled down. He looked down and saw a monstrous figure dragging his shadow. It was a demoness named Simhika. To escape from this danger, Hanuman came up with a plan. He grew his body until he was as big as a dark rain cloud. Simhika opened her mouth wide to match his size. Seizing the opportunity, Hanuman shrunk himself instantly, slipped out of her mouth, ripped open her stomach with his sharp claws, and flew out. The gods were all impressed by his quick thinking and intelligence. "Oh brave Maruti. Thanks to you killing the demons, we can live here peacefully. We bless you," the gods praised.

[Page 69]
Hanuman landed at the Trikootachala hill in Lanka. From there, he looked towards the golden Lanka. He was speechless by the magnificence of Ravana's kingdom. He waited inside Lanka until sunset, hiding from sunrise to sunset. When the moon rose, he reduced his body to the size of a cat and slowly and silently entered the city gate. Then, the guardian deity of Lanka stopped him. She looked at him with fierce eyes. She started questioning him, asking who he was. Hanuman's playful answer, "I just came to see this beautiful city and will leave as I came," enraged her. She tried to kick him out. Hanuman lost his control. He roared, raised his left fist, and punched her. She, who was struck by his blow, fell. That is when she remembered Brahma Deva's words. It became clear to her that Sita's abduction was the beginning of Lanka's downfall. She allowed Hanuman to enter Lanka.

[Page 70]
After entering the city, Hanuman wandered through all the streets searching for Sita. He went inside the palace and saw the gigantic Ravana sleeping, snoring like thunder. He thought Mandodari, who was sleeping beside him, might be Sita, but then he dismissed the idea. From there, he went to the Ashoka Grove and sat on the tip of the Simsapa tree, observing his surroundings.

Near the tree was a building, and in front of it sat a woman wearing a dirty cloth, crying. He wondered if she was Sita. Around her were strange creatures with one ear, a nose on their forehead, drooping tongues, and cracked lips making harsh cries, and creating chaos.

[Page 71]
Hanuman climbed the tree and waited there silently. Night passed and dawn arrived. Even though the Rakshasis created havoc, Sita didn't seem to be bothered by it. Hanuman wanted to make sure it was Sita and not an illusion created by Ravana. Ravana went there in the morning. He threatened the crying woman to marry him. It had become his daily routine. "Wretch! I will never even dream of anyone except Rama. Rama's arrow will surely take your life," she cursed him. Hanuman, who was sitting on the top of the tree, having heard and seen everything, was now certain that she was Sita.

[Page 72]
After Ravana had argued with Sita and angrily left, the demonesses started to torment Sita in various ways. They frightened and exhausted her with their shouting, screaming, flying, and kicking. Feeling helpless, Sita stood under the tree and started to pull her hair out of frustration. Then, seeing her distress, a demoness named Trijata, who had been scolding the other demonesses, cursed them and made them stop. "I had a dream that our king Ravana will be killed by Sita's husband Rama. Fools, stop all this noise. Don't torment this woman. If she shows mercy, we will be saved." Hearing this, all the other demonesses gave up their attempts and fell silent.

[Page 73]
Having heard about Trijata's dream, the Rakshasis prayed for it to not materialize. But they could only pray to Ravana. They knew it was futile. They sat down dejected and fell asleep after some time. Hanuman had recognized her but Sita did not know who Hanuman was. So, Hanuman, sitting on the tree, sang Rama's story so far in a soft voice that Sita could hear it.

"I am Hanuman. I have crossed the sea and am now seeing Sita here," he ended his singing. Sita who had seen through Ravana's trick earlier, was suspicious that this might be another one of his tricks. Realizing this, Hanuman, from the top of the tree, once again sang and praised Rama's qualities and deeds. Sita finally believed that he was indeed Rama's messenger.

[Page 74]
Hanuman descended from the tree and approached Sita. He gave her the ring with Rama's name on it. As soon as she saw it, Sita was overwhelmed with emotion. Tears welled up in her eyes and her body trembled. Hanuman then said, "Mother, Rama will come. He will definitely destroy Lanka, kill the demon Ravana, and rescue you. Please give me some token as a sign of our meeting." He held out his palm humbly. Sita gave him a piece of jewellery that she had tied in her sari. Hanuman then left after bidding her farewell.

[Page 75]
"What good is it to cross the ocean and go back without doing anything? If possible, I must provoke Ravana and learn about the size and strength of his army," thought Hanuman. As his first attempt to stir up Ravana's anger, he created havoc in the Ashoka grove. News reached Ravana that a Vanara had ravaged the royal garden. The enraged Ravana sent a part of his army but they were easily defeated by Hanuman's blows.

[Page 76]
Hanuman used anything that he could find as a weapon. He was not getting tired since he was constantly chanting Rama's name. Jambumali, Virupaksha, and Yupaksha, among other demons, came and were defeated by Hanuman. His fists were his strongest weapons and he punched his way through the army. Unable to resolve the issue, Ravana sent his son Akshakumara.

Hanuman broke him as if he were made of a twig and killed him. With no other alternatives left, he sent another son, Indrajit, who was an expert in magic. Using the Brahmastra, he controlled Hanuman's power and dragged him to Ravana's court. Hanuman was stunned to see the aura of Ravana.



[Page 77]
Hanuman was put on trial. "I am Hanuman, the messenger of Rama, Sugriva's Minister. You should surrender to Rama and return Sita Mata to him and repent for what you have done," he said firmly. Lankesh was livid and sentenced Hanuman to death. Ravana's brother Vibhishana stood up and argued that "killing a messenger is against all laws. If you must, disfigure him instead."

Ravana agreed and instead of death penalty, ordered that Hanuman's tail be set on fire. He reasoned that since the tail is an ornament to Vanaras, disfiguring it would be like striking them at their core. So, bundles of cloth and pots of oil were prepared to set Hanuman's tail on fire. They wrapped the cloths around his growing tail and finally set it on fire. Hanuman was then paraded through the city with his hands tied behind his back.

[Page 78]
Then Hanuman, having seen every corner of Lanka and made up his mind, finally loosened his grip and soared into the sky. He spread the fire that had been set to his tail and started a firestorm in all the houses of Lanka.

The fire engulfed the entire city, burning it to ashes. With the satisfaction of having burned down Lanka, Hanuman finally dipped his tail in the sea and extinguished the fire.

[Page 79]
Having crossed the ocean, Hanuman brought back good news. He gathered his army and, filled with joy, shouted, "I have found Sita!" He then went to Kishkindha with his companions and reached Prasravana Mountain where Rama was staying. As per Rama's request, he gave a detailed account of his journey to Lanka. When Hanuman bowed down and Rama saw the jewellery he was holding, Rama's eyes welled up and his heart became heavy. He embraced Hanuman tightly. Following Rama's orders, the Vanara army set out for Lanka at an auspicious hour and reached the foot of Mahendra Mountain.

[Page 80]
The chaos created by Hanuman disturbed Ravana greatly. The message that Rama's army would soon invade Lanka and cause havoc was clear. All the important people were gathered in the court and a consultation was held. Vibhishana advised that Ravana should first rectify his mistake and return Sita to Rama so that all the troubles would go away. This did not appeal to Ravana. He insulted Vibhishana with harsh words and ordered him to leave the assembly immediately. Vibhishana, along with his four loyal ministers, set out for Rama's camp and stopped midair.

[Page 81]
Vibhishana, who stood in the sky waiting for permission to land said, "I am Vibhishana, Ravana's younger brother. I have left Lanka and come to join Rama." Sugriva and other Vanara chiefs who had gathered below conveyed this matter to Rama. There was a serious discussion about whether to accept a person coming from enemy camp. "He is righteous, religious, and truthful. It is advisable to accept him," Hanuman advised Rama. Rama agreed with Hanuman and said, "It is my vow to give shelter to all living beings who surrender. I am bound by it." He agreed to Vibhishana's arrival. He embraced Vibhishana, who came down from the sky to the ground.

[Page 82]
Vibhishana informed Rama about the details of the important people in Ravana's army. After understanding all the strengths and weaknesses of Ravana's army, Rama said, "Friend! I will destroy all of Ravana's evil army and make you the king of Lanka. I will not leave for Ayodhya without finishing the task. This is Rama's word. We need more peacekeepers like you.

Ravana committed the crime of kidnapping Sita and I will punish him no matter what. We will hold the coronation right now." Abhisheka was done to Vibhishana with the water from the sea before Rama, with Lakshmana leading the way, and crowned him king.

[Page 83]
Ravana's intention was to not miss any opportunity to weaken Rama. For that, he took refuge in deception. A demon named Shuka, who came in the form of a parrot as Ravana's messenger, met Sugriva alone and said, "If Ravana abducts Sita, what is the benefit to you? You leave all these troubles and go to Kishkindha peacefully and rule the kingdom." The vanaras, who smelled Shuka's mean intention, attacked him fiercely and drove him away. Caught in these beatings, Shuka folded his hands to Rama and begged for his life. "It is against the king's Dharma to beat the messenger. Let him go," said Rama. Only then did Shuka get relief from Vanaras.

[Page 84]
Shardula ran to Ravana and informed him about the vast army of Vanaras waiting on the other side of the ocean, while Vibhishana, Sugriva and Hanuman were contemplating on how to cross the ocean with the entire army. "One way is to pray to the sea god with devotion and ask for a way. The sea god also has a debt to the Ikshvaku dynasty," said Vibhishana. Accordingly, Rama became meditative. But even after three days, there was no response from the other side. The sea was roaring without stopping. Rama, enraged, threatened with the Brahmastra, saying, "If you don't make way, I will dry up the ocean itself." The waves of the sea, frightened by his roar, receded. The sea god appeared. "Rama! I am a servant of God. I cannot violate the law. If you build a bridge with the help of Nala, the skilled craftsman in the Vanara army, I can hold it up."

[Page 85]
The work of building the bridge began. The Vanaras brought large trees and boulders and dumped them into the sea. They leveled the uneven parts and made it flat. They laid grass on the top layer to make it easier to walk.

On the first day, fourteen yojanas, the second day, twenty yojanas, the third day, twenty-one yojanas, the fourth day, twenty-two yojanas, the fifth day, twenty-three yojanas, a bridge of one hundred yojanas in length and ten yojanas in width was built.

[Page 86]
Using this bridge, the Vanara army, walking, swimming, leaping into the water, splashing each other, pushing, and pulling each other, and dancing, set out for Lanka with great joy. Some vanaras decided to swim instead of walking. They gloated about their bravery and skills to each other. Hanuman and Angada carried Rama and Lakshmana on their shoulders and took the skyward path.

[Page 87]
When the vanara army, whose numbers were beyond count, reached Ravana's army in Lanka, Dashamukha's throne shook. Through spies, Ravana obtained the details of the enemy army. "Oh, King. The army marching towards us is vast. They have powerful warriors like Nila, Angada, Nala, Shweta, Kumuda, Panasa, Sharabha, Tara, Dhoomra, Jambavanta, Vinata, Kaliana, Kesari, Shatbali, Pramathi, Gaja and many more. The Vanara who burnt our city is also with them. Even your brother has joined hands with them," they reported. Rama, engaged in making all the necessary preparations for the war, divided the Vanaras into several sections, stationed them at key points, gave them prior warnings, and prepared them. It was decided that during the war, only Rama, Lakshmana, Vibhishana, and his four ministers would be in human form.

[Page 88]
Rama's army approached, while Sita sat stubbornly in the Ashoka grove, unmoved by Ravana's temptations. When it became certain that there would be a war, Ravana resorted to trickery. He rushed to the Ashoka grove and shouted, "Fool. Your husband has fallen in battle. See his head lying in the dust." He then threw a magical replica of Rama's head on the ground. Sita, unaware of Ravana's cunning magic, was terrified and burst into tears, collapsing and lamenting. Meanwhile, Ravana received an urgent call for the war preparations and rushed out in a hurry. As soon as he left, the illusionary head disappeared.

[Page 89]
Among those assigned to guard Sita, Sarama had compassion for Sita. She told Sita about Ravana's cunning tricks and said, "Rama is the noblest of men. It is impossible for the demons to kill him. Be calm. Do not lose courage. Ravana will be defeated and Rama will win." She spoke words of hope and instilled confidence in Sita.

[Page 90]
When times are bad, the advice of elders seems like bitter medicine to the wicked. This is what happened to Ravana. Ravana's mother Kaikasi's uncle Malyavanta, said to the arrogant Ravana, "Don't break your head in vain by fighting Rama. The strength and capability of Rama are evident from the bridge he has built. It is better to live peacefully by making friends with him than to die fighting him. Make peace with him and give Sita back to him. Since inauspicious signs are appearing everywhere, it is wise and intelligent of you to think and take a step in the right direction." Ravana arrogantly replied, "This is how I am. I will not bow down to anyone. Know this as a flaw that came with my birth." Malyavanta left the place without a word.

[Page 91]
After Hanuman had burned down Lanka, Ravana had fetched Vishwakarma and built a new Lanka overnight. He couldn't bear the insult of a Vanara burning down his kingdom. As Rama climbed the Suvelachala in Lanka, the magnificent city of Lanka came into view. The entire Vanara army was speechless for a moment at the sight of the grandeur of Lanka, which was built by Vishwakarma. At that very moment, Ravana, who was standing on a sky-high tower watching the gathering of the Vanara army, was identified as Ravana by Sugriva from his expressions and appearance.

Sugriva, in a fit of rage, leaped towards Ravana, snatched his crown, and threw it to the ground. In this unexpected turn of events, Ravana, enraged, showered arrows on Sugriva. Both bled profusely. Sugriva, noticing that Ravana was trying to use his magical powers to subdue him, immediately jumped back into the sky and returned to Rama. Rama, seeing Sugriva's foolish act, rebuked him harshly. Sugriva, realizing the danger he had caused due to his impulsiveness, stood with his head hung in shame.

[Page 92]
Even though there was no way around the situation, Rama wanted to follow the king's dharma of trying for peace till the very end and sent Angada as a messenger to Ravana. "Do not fight with Rama. If you hand over Sita to Rama, there will be no cause of war. It is not right for millions of rakshasas to die because of your stubbornness," said Angada. Ravana, enraged by Angada's words, shouted, "Catch him, kill him, tear him apart!" The soldiers came forward to grab his arms. Angada lifted them all in his arms, tossed them into the air and slammed them to the ground. Everyone who rushed forward fell to the ground. Angada, without stopping, jumped, and leaped in all directions, uprooted the golden tower of Ravana's palace, and finally reached Rama's camp.

[Page 93]
With the peace efforts having failed, the only thing left was war. Soldiers from both sides gathered like mountains. They brandished and sharpened their weapons, rushed forward, and killed their enemies, building a mountain of corpses.

While the demon army had weapons like clubs, spears, and swords, the Vanaras used whatever they could find - trees, stones, and boulders. The sky rained arrows! Rama killed Aniketu and Durdharsha. Lakshmana killed Virupaksha.

[Page 94]
Even though the sun had set, there was no respite from the war. The battle continued even in the darkness of the night. Shouting "Hey Vanara! Hey demon!" both sides fought and attacked each other. Angada had greatly troubled Ravana's son Meghanada. Meghanada was an expert in illusion and magic. He had received a boon from Brahma and had even defeated Indra in battle. Therefore, he had another name, Indrajit. When he used the Nagastra, both Rama and Lakshmana were affected by its power and fell unconscious. The Vanara army was lost and confused. Seeing the two lying on the ground, Indrajit, overjoyed, rushed to Ravana, and announced, "Rama and Lakshmana are both dead." Ravana, pleased, hugged and praised the brave warrior.

[Page 95]
Ravana announced Rama and Lakshmana were dead in Lanka. Sita was taken in Pushpaka Vimana to the battlefield and shown Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious. She was overwhelmed with grief. Then Trijata, who was there to guard her, filled her with courage with her words, "Sita, don't lose courage."

"Look at the faces of those brave men lying on the ground. How radiant they are even in their unconsciousness. If they were really dead, Pushpaka wouldn't be carrying you. They are both alive. Rama's victory is definite." Saying so, she filled Sita with strength. Pushpaka then flew back to Ashoka vana.

[Page 96]
When the influence of Maya astra faded, Rama woke up. Seeing Lakshmana lying dead in a pool of blood, Rama thought he was dead and cried. "Why should I live when my beloved brother is dead?" he grieved, and prepared to take his own life. Then the wind blew as if a fierce storm had arisen, creating an illusion. Garuda, the king of birds, arrived there.

As he flew down, all the snakes that had bound Rama and Lakshmana fled in all directions. Garuda, the son of Vinata, also known as Vainateya, gently touched Rama and Lakshmana's bodies with his wings. All the wounds were healed and their bodies were rejuvenated. Garuda bowed down to Rama and circled him before disappearing into the sky.

[Page 97]
Ravana was furious upon hearing the news of Rama and Lakshmana being alive. The strength of the vanara army had increased exponentially. They climbed on the chariots, they threw away the flags and broke the wheels. They even uprooted huge trees and barricaded the chariots with them.

They teased ministers of Ravana's army by wearing their crowns and laughing at them. He sent the mighty Dhumraksha, who rained arrows on the Vanara army. But Hanuman lifted a large boulder with ease and spun it around, crushing Dhumraksha under it. The Vanaras were relieved.

[Page 98]
One by one, the warriors from Ravana's palace came out. Vajradamshtra came after Dhumraksha had fallen. He was killed by Angada. Then Akampana fought all night. Hanuman was covered by the arrows that Akampana shot at him. Enraged, Hanuman jumped and roared. He uprooted a large tree and threw it at Akampana, crushing him.

Seeing all their warriors being killed by the Vanaras, the Rakshasa army trembled with fear. Their throats dried up and spines shivered. Ravana's wife, Mandodari fell to his feet and said, "Oh king, please surrender. Rama and Lakshmana are not simple humans. Do not play with fire. Please return Sita Mata to Rama." The begging fell on deaf ears.

[Page 99]
Next came Prahasta, the chief minister of Ravana, to the battlefield. The Vanara army easily defeated the other Rakshasa warriors who came with him. Prahasta fought valiantly against Nila, the Vanara leader. Finally, Nila lifted a large hill and dropped it on Prahasta's head, killing him instantly.

[Page 100]
Thus all the brave warriors who were sent by Ravana perished on the battlefield. Ravana had no choice but fight himself. He entered the battlefield with Atikaya, Mahodara, Pishaca, Trishira, Kumbha, Nikumbha, Narantaka, Devantaka and other warriors.

Rama was momentarily stunned by Ravana's radiant form. He admired Ravana's strength and brilliance before engaging in battle. Rama's arrows caused trouble to Ravana. Sugriva, Hanuman, and Lakshmana proved ineffective against Ravana's valor.

[Page 101]
Nila danced and mocked Ravana by pulling off his crown and shaking his flagpole. This enraged Ravana, who then used the Agneyastra weapon on Nila. However, Nila being the son of Agni, the fire god was not harmed. Seeing Rama standing on the ground, Hanuman immediately lifted him onto his shoulders and brought him to the battlefield, determined not to let Ravana gain the upper hand. Hanuman became both Rama's chariot and charioteer. Ravana's face was etched with worry as he was struck by countless arrows from Rama's bow and was getting tired. Rama then asked Ravana to return to Lanka, defeated. Ravana's chariot retreated from the battlefield.

[Page 102]
Ravana's brother Kumbhakarna had a boon from Brahma that he would sleep for six months and then wake up and eat for one day. When the time came for him to wake up, Ravana decided to send him to the battlefield. He had prepared mountains of meat and drinks for Kumbhakarna to eat after he woke up. They blew conch shells, beat drums and gongs, pricked him with needles, poured water in his ears, beat him with clubs, tied ropes to his body and dragged him, and even shouted in his ears.

Nothing woke him up. Finally, a thousand elephants were made to run over him. Only then did Kumbhakarna stir. He woke up and looked around. He saw mountains of food and drink and was overjoyed. Having finished all the food in record time, he asked why he had been woken up. The soldiers, trembling with fear, explained the situation. Kumbhakarna understood and immediately set off to Ravana's court, taking large strides.

[Page 103]
Ravana did not listen to Kumbhakarna's wisdom. He just wanted Kumbhakarna to fight. Kumbhakarna finally obliged and took on a giant form and rushed towards the Vanara army. The Vanaras under his feet screamed in fear. What could their bodies do against Kumbhakarna's towering figure! However, Hanuman grabbed Kumbhakarna's mace and broke it. Sugriva bit his ears and nose. When blood oozed out there, Kumbhakarna roared in pain and lifted Sugriva up to the sky. Somehow escaping from his grip, Sugriva quickly jumped and reached Rama.

[Page 104]
Enraged by the Vanara's mischief, half tired, half irritated, and boiling with rage, Kumbhakarna re-entered the battlefield. He grabbed Vanaras in his hands and stuffed them into his mouth. Some Vanaras came out of his ears, and some came out of his nostrils.

Others poked out of the gaps in his armor. Vanara heroes from the neighboring hills leaped onto Kumbhakarna's body. Because of the Vanaras clinging all over him, he looked like a mountain range covered in hundreds of trees.

[Page 105]
The Vanaras saw that Rama was the only one who could defeat this giant. Rama and Lakshmana fought Kumbhakarna with their arrows. Rama fired the Vayavya, Aindra, and Ardhachandra arrows, cutting off Kumbhakarna's arms and legs. But the relentless demon, undeterred, opened his mouth wide to swallow Rama. Rama then used the divine Aindrastra to sever the demon's neck. As his head fell, it smashed into the buildings causing them to crumble. The headless, limbless torso rolled away finally falling into the sea.

[Page 106]
The enemy's army was diminishing. The demon warriors Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka, Mahodara, and others were slain by the Vanara army and lay dead on the battlefield. Lakshmana had killed Ravana's powerful son Atikaya. Another son of Ravana, Meghanada realized that he could not defeat them in direct combat. He was skilled in illusion and magic, performed a powerful Yajna to increase his magical powers and entered the battlefield. He hid in the clouds and attacked Rama and Lakshmana with illusions. He used the extremely powerful Brahmastra against Rama and Lakshmana. Hanuman was unharmed by the Brahmastra since he was blessed by Brahmadeva himself. All the Vanara warriors and Rama and Lakshmana were struck by the power of the astra and fainted and fell on the battlefield, creating a gruesome scene. In the darkness of the night, Hanuman and Vibhishana came looking for soldiers, became happy seeing Jambavan alive.

[Page 107]
Hanuman could single-handedly save Rama's army said Jambavan. He asked him to fetch four medicinal herbs from the mountain between Vrishaba and Kailasa mountains. Hanuman immediately flew up into the sky in the darkness and brought back not just the herbs, but the entire mountain. As the scent from the herbs wafted, all the Vanara warriors who had fainted woke up. Their wounds healed, their bones joined, their skin grew back and their consciousness returned by Vishalyakarani, Sandhanakarani, Savarnyakarani and Mritasanjeevini respectively. Rama and Lakshmana also woke up thanks to the Sanjeevini herbs. Following Jambavan's advice, Hanuman then put the mountain back in its place. Ravana had advised his soldiers to throw all the dead rakshasas into the sea because of which they could not be revived by the power of the herbs.

[Page 108]
Kumbhakarna's sons, Kumbha and Nikumbha, were killed by Sugriva and Hanuman, respectively. Makaraksha, the son of Khara, was killed by Rama. Indrajit then performed another magical yajna to increase his evil powers and entered the battlefield. He created an illusion of Sita and took her away.

He made sure they were visible to the Vanara army and then slit Sita's throat. The vanara army was heartbroken and confused. Thinking that Sita had really been killed, Hanuman ran to Rama and Lakshmana and told them what had happened. Rama was devastated and his grief knew no bounds.

[Page 109]
Vibhishana, who knew about Indrajit's magical skills, came to Rama and told him the truth. He said that Indrajit was performing a powerful yajna to increase his strength and that he had gone to Nikumbhila temple to complete the yajna. He said that the yajna had to be stopped before it was completed, and that Lakshmana should do this task.

With Rama's permission, Lakshmana went to the Nikumbhila temple. Indrajit, enraged that his yajna had been interrupted, came out and fought with Lakshmana. The battle lasted for three days and three nights. Finally, Lakshmana remembered Rama and used the powerful Aindrastra. The astra cut off Indrajit's head and sent it flying.

[Page 110]
Ravana had lost all his loved ones in the battle. The rakshasa army was in deep trouble. Burning with anger and grief at the death of his beloved son Indrajit, Ravana decided to kill Sita. He drew his sword and went to Sita's hut. In that moment of crisis, the wise minister Suparshwa intervened.

He advised Ravana not to kill Sita, as it would be a sin and would bring shame upon him. He suggested that Ravana wait until the next day, Amavasya, when his powers would be at their peak, and then fight Rama and the Vanara army. Ravana agreed and put his sword away.

[Page 111]
The battlefield was prepared for the Rama-Ravana war. Vibhishana had gone away, Kumbhakarna was killed, all his children were killed along with ministers. Ravana felt lonely. He thought that if he died, that would be the end of Rakshasa clan. He couldn't let that happen. He climbed his chariot with determination and entered the war to face Rama.

The god Indra, with the charioteer Matali, sent his chariot for Rama. Rama, mounted on the chariot, went to war. To witness this fight of equals, the assembly of gods and goddesses lined up in the sky. Ravana, who was suffering from the pain of Rama's arrows, left the battlefield for the time being. At that time, Lord Agastya came down from the sky and taught Rama the Aditya Hridaya mantra.

[Page 112]
After Ravana returned, the two fought fiercely in a way the world had never seen before. Rama used the Vishasarpa astra many times to cut off Ravana's head, but every time, it grew back. When Matali suggested that Rama use the Brahmastra, Rama did so. Ravana was terrified of the power of the Brahmastra.

The weapon pierced Ravana's chest, came out of his back, and then returned to Rama's quiver. As Ravana's body fell to the ground, the storm that had been raging across the earth until then stopped, and an eerie calm descended upon the surroundings.

[Page 113]
Vibhishana was grief-stricken upon seeing Ravana's dead body. "The mighty Ravana, once the most valiant warrior and scholar, has met such an end. He ignored my warnings and brought this doom upon himself," he cried. He remembered the old days and grieved. "He was the warrior who had conquered everything. He had studied all the Vedas. A great warrior's life has ended in such a pathetic way today," he lamented. Rama consoled Vibhishana and said, "Perform the last rites for your brother as per the scriptures. He died a hero's death."

[Page 114]
Mandodari came with her maids to see Ravana's body. She was overcome with grief and cried, "Even after conquering Indra and other gods, you could not conquer your senses. You desired Sita, a woman of great virtue, and brought death upon yourself. Because of your lust and anger, all the brave warriors of the Rakshasa race have been destroyed." She wept bitterly, her cries of sorrow echoed across the battlefield. Initially, Vibhishana refused to perform the last rites for Ravana. However, Rama persuaded him, saying, "Whatever the enmity between you two, it should end with his death. It is your duty as a brother to perform his last rites."

[Page 115]
Hanuman rushed to Ashokavana to convey the good news of Ravana's death and Rama's victory to Sita. Upon hearing the news, Sita was overjoyed. Seeing the Rakshasa women who had surrounded and tormented her all this time, "If you permit me, I will kill them all and send them to Yama Puri," Hanuman, with eyes blazing with anger, roared. "No please!" pleaded Sita. "They were just carrying out the orders of their king. My suffering is my own karma, and they are not to be blamed." Sita then expressed her desire to see Rama. Hanuman immediately flew back to Rama to convey Sita's message.

[Page 116]
Ravana's death left the throne empty. Vibhishana took his place on the throne as per Rama's instructions. Vibhishana brought Sita before Rama. Sita, her face radiant with joy after being reunited with Rama, wept tears of relief. But Rama's face remained grim. His voice, thick with anger and hurt, rang out: "How can I accept you back after you spent so much time with Ravana? My war with Ravana was not for you, but for the sake of my clan's honor. You are free to go wherever you wish." The vanara army was left speechless after hearing Rama utter those words. Hanuman was stunned to hear this. "Was he the same Rama who would look at Sita's jewellery and cry for hours remembering her?" he wondered.

[Page 117]
Sita was furious. "Oh Rama, don't you know my character and qualities? Do you doubt it? Even living for a moment with such an accusation is a sin," she said, and turning to Lakshmana, she said, "Build a pyre." Lakshmana prepared the pyre and Sita climbed on it, praying, "If I have ever thought of anyone other than Rama in my mind let the flames of fire swallow me." Saying so, she jumped into the blazing fire. Rama's eyes were blurred with tears. Agni Deva emerged from the fire with Sita in his lap. "Rama," he commanded, "Sita is pure in body, speech, and mind. Accept her without doubt." "Agni Deva, I know this too. What I did was only to remove the stain from the world. Sita is my life," said Rama, bowing down with devotion, and accepted Sita.

[Page 118]
Bharata's words were that he would enter the fire if there was the slightest delay in returning after the completion of the exile period. The period of exile was coming to an end. Rama, along with his entourage, left for Ayodhya to meet Bharata without delay. Everyone travelled through the sky in Pushpaka Vimana, which belonged to Vibhishana, and reached Kosala. When the city of Ayodhya appeared, Rama and Sita bowed to it with respect.

Rama met Bharata at Nandigrama. Bharata was overwhelmed at the return of his beloved Rama. Everyone shed happy tears. Bharata returned the golden slippers back to Rama and said that his responsibilities were completed. Rama, Lakshmana and Bharata changed their attire and wore the clothes that were fit for the princes. Bharata took Rama, Lakshmana and Sita in a golden chariot and brought them to Ayodhya.

[Page 119]
It felt like life had returned to Ayodhya. Everyone celebrated the return of their beloved Rama. People from Lanka and Kishkindha too had arrived to partake in the celebrations. Sita and Rama were asked to sit on the Golden Throne by Maharishi Vasishtha. Ashta Maharishis, the eight great sages, performed Abhisheka on Rama with holy water.

[Page 120]
Ayodhya glowed as if it was a bride. Thousands of lamps were lit on the banks of Sarayu river. Coronation took place soon. Music and dance programs were held. The gods and goddesses were present to witness the coronation. After Rama's coronation ceremony was performed with great pomp, Bharata became the Yuvaraja. Along with his brothers, with all the entourage, as a king who loved his people, as a world-famous king, as a person of virtues, the righteous king Rama ruled the kingdom for eleven thousand years.
