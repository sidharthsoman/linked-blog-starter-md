Guru [[Vasishtha]] realized that the situation was taking a dark turn and gave [[Rama]] the golden sandals he had brought from [[Ayodhya]]. [[Rama]], understanding his intentions, touched them with his feet and returned them. [[Bharata]], placing the sandals on his head, said "Brother, if I do not see you by the time fourteen years exile is over, I will enter the fire." [[Bharata]] installed the sandals touched by [[Rama]]'s feet on the throne of [[Ayodhya]]. He also took a vow of vanavasa like [[Rama]], wore matted hair and lived in [[Nandigrama]] outside [[Ayodhya]]. He did not become the king. He considered [[Rama]] the king of [[Ayodhya]] and himself as his representative.
