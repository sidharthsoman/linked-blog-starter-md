This time the chariot touched [[Shringiberapur]] on the banks of [[Ganga]]. The one who ruled the province was [[Guha]], the king of [[Nishada]] tribe, who was a friend of [[Rama]]. [[Guha]], who had heard the news of [[Rama]]'s arrival, had already started preparing for the hospitality of the guests. He ordered the preparation of various kinds of food. But [[Rama]], who had become an ascetic during his exile, had taken a vow to eat nothing but fruits and berries found in the forest. Therefore, he politely refused the royal meal offered by [[Guha]]. "Please don't feel bad. Our hearts are filled with the love you showed us today. Please help us by giving us a boat for the journey ahead," [[Rama]] requested. [[Guha]] accepted even though he was upset about the developments. He was happy to be of service to them in any way possible. They spent the night on the banks of the [[Ganga]] and prepared for the next day's journey. A nice boat was also made ready by [[Guha]] for [[Rama]]'s journey.
