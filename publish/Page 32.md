As [[Rama]], [[Sita]] and [[Lakshmana]] proceeded from [[Chitrakuta]], they met the sage [[Atri]] at his ashram. The sage's wife was delighted upon their arrival. She adorned [[Sita]] with ornaments and felt blessed to see her in such a divine form. Sage [[Atri]] then showed them the way to [[Dandakaranya]]. Upon arrival, a fierce and terrible demon appeared on the way. He stood blocking the way and tried to abduct [[Sita]]. He threatened and roared. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] subdued the demon with sharp arrows. They cut off his arms that had touched [[Sita]] and threw them away. The demon, burning and suffering with remorse, said that his name was [[Viradha]] and that he had become a demon due to [[Kubera]]'s curse. He begged them to cremate his body so that his curse would be lifted. [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] cremated him which lifted [[Viradha]]'s curse.
