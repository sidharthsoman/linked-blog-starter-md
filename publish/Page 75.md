"What good is it to cross the ocean and go back without doing anything? If possible, I must provoke [[Ravana]] and learn about the size and strength of his army," thought [[Hanuman]]. As his first attempt to stir up [[Ravana]]'s anger, he created havoc in the [[Ashoka]] grove. News reached [[Ravana]] that a Vanara had ravaged the royal garden. The enraged [[Ravana]] sent a part of his army but they were easily defeated by [[Hanuman]]'s blows.
