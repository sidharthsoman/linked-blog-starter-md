[[Ravana]] took [[Sita]] to [[Lanka]] and kept her in a splendid palace. He displayed his luxurious life to her, showed her his military power, and demanded her to marry him. But [[Sita]] would not listen to him. "My husband [[Rama]] will come and destroy [[Lanka]]. You will die a gruesome death," she declared in a firm voice. [[Ravana]] enraged confined her to the [[Ashoka]] grove and assigned a group of fierce rakshasis to guard her. He gave her a deadline to marry him within twelve months.
