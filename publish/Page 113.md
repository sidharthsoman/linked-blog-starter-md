[[Vibhishana]] was grief-stricken upon seeing [[Ravana]]'s dead body. "The mighty [[Ravana]], once the most valiant warrior and scholar, has met such an end. He ignored my warnings and brought this doom upon himself," he cried. He remembered the old days and grieved. "He was the warrior who had conquered everything. He had studied all the [[Vedas]]. A great warrior's life has ended in such a pathetic way today," he lamented. [[Rama]] consoled [[Vibhishana]] and said, "Perform the last rites for your brother as per the scriptures. He died a hero's death."
