Using this bridge, the Vanara army, walking, swimming, leaping into the water, splashing each other, pushing, and pulling each other, and dancing, set out for [[Lanka]] with great joy. Some vanaras decided to swim instead of walking. They gloated about their bravery and skills to each other. [[Hanuman]] and [[Angada]] carried [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] on their shoulders and took the skyward path.
