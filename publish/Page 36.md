The banks of [[Godavari]] were laced with beautiful trees that bore a variety of fruits and flowers that emanated a lovely scent. There was greenery as far as the eyes could see. The sweet water of the [[Godavari]] river quenched thirst. Nothing came close to the beauty of the sunrise they witnessed there. Animals like deer, rabbits and peacocks could be found roaming around there. They could spend the whole day listening to the birds chirp. The fog in the early morning gave it a mystic feel and the stars that littered the night sky mesmerized them. They had decided this was the perfect place for them to build a hut. They built a leaf hut with mud walls and a roof made of [[Shami]] tree branches, and built windows for the breeze to flow in. [[Sita]] decorated the hut diligently. They started to live peacefully.
