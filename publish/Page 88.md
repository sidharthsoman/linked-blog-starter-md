[[Rama]]'s army approached, while [[Sita]] sat stubbornly in the [[Ashoka]] grove, unmoved by [[Ravana]]'s temptations. When it became certain that there would be a war, [[Ravana]] resorted to trickery. He rushed to the [[Ashoka]] grove and shouted, "Fool. Your husband has fallen in battle. See his head lying in the dust." He then threw a magical replica of [[Rama]]'s head on the ground. [[Sita]], unaware of [[Ravana]]'s cunning magic, was terrified and burst into tears, collapsing and lamenting. Meanwhile, [[Ravana]] received an urgent call for the war preparations and rushed out in a hurry. As soon as he left, the illusionary head disappeared.
