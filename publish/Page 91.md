After [[Hanuman]] had burned down [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]] had fetched [[Vishwakarma]] and built a new [[Lanka]] overnight. He couldn't bear the insult of a Vanara burning down his kingdom. As [[Rama]] climbed the [[Suvelachala]] in [[Lanka]], the magnificent city of [[Lanka]] came into view. The entire Vanara army was speechless for a moment at the sight of the grandeur of [[Lanka]], which was built by [[Vishwakarma]]. At that very moment, [[Ravana]], who was standing on a sky-high tower watching the gathering of the Vanara army, was identified as [[Ravana]] by [[Sugriva]] from his expressions and appearance.

[[Sugriva]], in a fit of rage, leaped towards [[Ravana]], snatched his crown, and threw it to the ground. In this unexpected turn of events, [[Ravana]], enraged, showered arrows on [[Sugriva]]. Both bled profusely. [[Sugriva]], noticing that [[Ravana]] was trying to use his magical powers to subdue him, immediately jumped back into the sky and returned to [[Rama]]. [[Rama]], seeing [[Sugriva]]'s foolish act, rebuked him harshly. [[Sugriva]], realizing the danger he had caused due to his impulsiveness, stood with his head hung in shame.
