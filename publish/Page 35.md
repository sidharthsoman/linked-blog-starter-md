The three of them continued walking towards the direction pointed by Maharishi [[Agastya]]. [[Sita]] then decided to ask [[Rama]], "Since you have sacrificed the throne and live as an austere, why do you kill the demons? Isn't that against the principles of austere?" [[Rama]] replied calmly, "Just like it is the dharma of fire to burn, it is the [[Kshatriya]]'s dharma to destroy evil. We don't need the throne for doing our duty." As they traveled further into the forest, they saw a large bird sitting on a branch of a huge tree. [[Rama]] became fully alert, thinking it was some kind of demon. Then the bird said, "Oh [[Rama]], don't kill me, I am your father's friend. My name is [[Jatayu]]. My father is [[Aruna]], my mother is [[Shyeni]] and [[Sampati]] is my elder brother. The atrocities of cruel demons are rampant in this forest. Whenever you and your brother leave the cottage, I will protect [[Sita]]." [[Rama]] was grateful to [[Jatayu]].
