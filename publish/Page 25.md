[[Dasharatha]] was heartbroken by [[Rama]]'s separation. He was unable to bear the sight of [[Kaikeyi]]'s face. He cried day and night. He shed tears remembering [[Rama]]. "[[Kausalya]], my death is near. If my son [[Rama]] comes back, all my sorrows will disappear. Tell me, [[Kausalya]], will he come? Will he come and comfort me?" he cried like a child. It was already evening when [[Sumantra]] returned to [[Ayodhya]]. He grieved the departure of [[Rama]]. He didn't want to meet anyone and wanted some solitude but he had to do his duty. He had to report to the king [[Dasharatha]] that [[Rama]] had begun his exile in the forest. He went to Queen [[Kausalya]]'s palace. He found [[Dasharatha]] in a sorry state. His eyes had puffed up from crying and his voice had become hoarse. Only his lips moved while repeatedly saying "[[Rama]]". When he heard that [[Rama]] had not returned, he yelled, "[[Rama]], [[Rama]]" and fell unconscious.
