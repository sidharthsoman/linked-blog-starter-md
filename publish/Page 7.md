Maharishi [[Vasishtha]] trained the four princes in weaponry and scriptures. He raised them to be virtuous and valiant. When the princes turned sixteen, the sage [[Vishwamitra]] visited [[Dasharatha]]'s court. After receiving a warm welcome from King [[Dasharatha]], he said painfully, "Oh mighty king, the demons have wreaked havoc in our lives. They disrupt all our yajnas. There is no one who can stop them. Could you please send your son, [[Rama]], to help me put an end to this?" Though [[Dasharatha]] was initially hesitant due to his love for [[Rama]], he heeded [[Vasishtha]]'s advice and entrusted [[Rama]] to [[Vishwamitra]]. [[Lakshmana]] also accompanied his elder brother.
