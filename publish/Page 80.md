The chaos created by [[Hanuman]] disturbed [[Ravana]] greatly. The message that [[Rama]]'s army would soon invade [[Lanka]] and cause havoc was clear. All the important people were gathered in the court and a consultation was held. [[Vibhishana]] advised that [[Ravana]] should first rectify his mistake and return [[Sita]] to [[Rama]] so that all the troubles would go away. This did not appeal to [[Ravana]]. He insulted [[Vibhishana]] with harsh words and ordered him to leave the assembly immediately. [[Vibhishana]], along with his four loyal ministers, set out for [[Rama]]'s camp and stopped midair.
