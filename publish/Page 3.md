[[Narada]] muni also inspired the [[Ramayana]] story. When [[Valmiki]] maharishi met [[Narada]], he said, "Tell me about an exemplary individual in the world, who is full of good qualities and virtues." In turn, [[Narada]] briefly mentioned the noble life of [[Rama]]. It was his story that later blossomed in [[Valmiki]] maharishi and became the [[Ramayana]] poem. [[Valmiki]]'s epic poem is divided into [[Balakanda]], [[Ayodhya kanda]], [[Aranya kanda]], [[Kishkinda kanda]], [[Sundara kanda]] and [[Yuddha kanda]].
