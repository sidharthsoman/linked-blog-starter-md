The battlefield was prepared for the [[Rama]]-[[Ravana]] war. [[Vibhishana]] had gone away, [[Kumbhakarna]] was killed, all his children were killed along with ministers. [[Ravana]] felt lonely. He thought that if he died, that would be the end of Rakshasa clan. He couldn't let that happen. He climbed his chariot with determination and entered the war to face [[Rama]].

The god [[Indra]], with the charioteer [[Matali]], sent his chariot for [[Rama]]. [[Rama]], mounted on the chariot, went to war. To witness this fight of equals, the assembly of gods and goddesses lined up in the sky. [[Ravana]], who was suffering from the pain of [[Rama]]'s arrows, left the battlefield for the time being. At that time, Lord [[Agastya]] came down from the sky and taught [[Rama]] the [[Aditya Hridaya]] mantra.
