[[Ayodhya]] was ready before the sun even rose for coronation. [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] had fasted, slept on the floor as a part of the rituals. They bathed and wore new clothes. "Rule the kingdom in such a way that even the poorest person receives justice," blessed sage [[Vasishtha]]. [[Sumantra]] brought [[Rama]] before [[Dasharatha]] as per [[Kaikeyi]]'s order. As soon as [[Dasharatha]] saw [[Rama]]'s face, he was overcome with grief. He couldn't speak. He hugged [[Rama]] tightly and cried. His tears drenched [[Rama]]'s shoulders. He fainted again. [[Rama]] asked [[Kaikeyi]] about the reason. [[Kaikeyi]], devoid of any compassion, narrated the entire incident. "[[Dasharatha]], under the influence of anger, had granted two boons to me. Now those boons were destined to fulfill my wishes. As per the books, [[Bharata]] would be crowned as the king and [[Rama]] would have to go to the forest for fourteen years. To fulfill his promises, [[Rama]] had to leave for the forest immediately," she said harshly.
