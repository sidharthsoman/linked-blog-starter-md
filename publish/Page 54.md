[[Hanuman]] explained [[Rama]]'s story to [[Sugriva]]. [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]], who were suffering equally, shook hands with each other. [[Rama]] embraced [[Sugriva]] deeply and vowed to be friends forever. [[Rama]] swore that he would kill [[Vali]] and [[Sugriva]] swore that he would help find [[Sita]]. Both [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]] put their hands in the fire lit by [[Hanuman]], and took an oath to share their happiness and sorrows. "Long back, Rishi [[Matanga]] had cursed [[Vali]] that he would die if he stepped on the [[Rishyamukha]] mountains. His curse turned into a boon for me. I hid here when he chased me. He knows that I am here but he can't do anything about it. Please kill [[Vali]] and help me. His kingdom will be mine along with the complete Vanara army," [[Sugriva]] explained his predicament. [[Rama]] promised to kill [[Vali]].
