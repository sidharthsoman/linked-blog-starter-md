[[Vasishtha]] called [[Rishyashringa]], son of [[Vibhandaka Muni]], and asked him to perform [[Putrakameshti]] Yajna for King [[Dasharatha]]. [[Putrakameshti]] is a ritual performed to wish for children. [[Dasharatha]] performed the ritual with such devotion that at the end of the ritual, a divine-looking yajnapurusha appeared in the fire of the yajna kunda and gave [[Dasharatha]] a pot of divine payasam. [[Dasharatha]] shared it with his three wives. Due to the divine payasam, the three queens became pregnant. [[Kausalya]] gave birth to [[Rama]], [[Kaikeyi]] to [[Bharata]], and [[Sumitra]] to [[Lakshmana]] and [[Shatrughna]]. The children's faces had a divine glow. The people of the kingdom were eager to see the princes. On the other hand, the servants in the palace fought joyfully among themselves to take care of the princes in the way of bathing them, dressing them up, singing them lullabies if they were sleepy and to shower them with love when they woke up.
