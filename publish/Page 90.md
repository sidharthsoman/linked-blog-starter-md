When times are bad, the advice of elders seems like bitter medicine to the wicked. This is what happened to [[Ravana]]. [[Ravana]]'s mother [[Kaikasi]]'s uncle [[Malyavanta]], said to the arrogant [[Ravana]], "Don't break your head in vain by fighting [[Rama]]. The strength and capability of [[Rama]] are evident from the bridge he has built. It is better to live peacefully by making friends with him than to die fighting him. Make peace with him and give [[Sita]] back to him. Since inauspicious signs are appearing everywhere, it is wise and intelligent of you to think and take a step in the right direction." [[Ravana]] arrogantly replied, "This is how I am. I will not bow down to anyone. Know this as a flaw that came with my birth." [[Malyavanta]] left the place without a word.
