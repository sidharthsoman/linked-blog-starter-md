[[Vibhishana]], who stood in the sky waiting for permission to land said, "I am [[Vibhishana]], [[Ravana]]'s younger brother. I have left [[Lanka]] and come to join [[Rama]]." [[Sugriva]] and other Vanara chiefs who had gathered below conveyed this matter to [[Rama]]. There was a serious discussion about whether to accept a person coming from enemy camp. "He is righteous, religious, and truthful. It is advisable to accept him," [[Hanuman]] advised [[Rama]]. [[Rama]] agreed with [[Hanuman]] and said, "It is my vow to give shelter to all living beings who surrender. I am bound by it." He agreed to [[Vibhishana]]'s arrival. He embraced [[Vibhishana]], who came down from the sky to the ground.
