From there [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Sita]] came across the ashramas of many sages. They met [[Sharabhanga]] maharishi. He was chanting the [[Ramataraka]] mantra and was waiting to meet [[Rama]]. Happy to have met [[Rama]], he attained moksha. The trio moved ahead and reached [[Sutikshna]] muni's ashram. [[Sutikshna]] said, "[[Dandakaranya]] is a land of penance. Meet all the sages here and receive their blessings. Enjoy the beauty of nature here for days." Following his suggestion, [[Rama]] spent ten years of his exile meeting sages and enjoying the beauty of nature.
