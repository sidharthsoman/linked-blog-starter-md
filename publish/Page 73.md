Having heard about [[Trijata]]'s dream, the Rakshasis prayed for it to not materialize. But they could only pray to [[Ravana]]. They knew it was futile. They sat down dejected and fell asleep after some time. [[Hanuman]] had recognized her but [[Sita]] did not know who [[Hanuman]] was. So, [[Hanuman]], sitting on the tree, sang [[Rama]]'s story so far in a soft voice that [[Sita]] could hear it.

"I am [[Hanuman]]. I have crossed the sea and am now seeing [[Sita]] here," he ended his singing. [[Sita]] who had seen through [[Ravana]]'s trick earlier, was suspicious that this might be another one of his tricks. Realizing this, [[Hanuman]], from the top of the tree, once again sang and praised [[Rama]]'s qualities and deeds. [[Sita]] finally believed that he was indeed [[Rama]]'s messenger.
