As [[Hanuman]] was flying through the sky, he felt his body being pulled down. He looked down and saw a monstrous figure dragging his shadow. It was a demoness named [[Simhika]]. To escape from this danger, [[Hanuman]] came up with a plan. He grew his body until he was as big as a dark rain cloud. [[Simhika]] opened her mouth wide to match his size. Seizing the opportunity, [[Hanuman]] shrunk himself instantly, slipped out of her mouth, ripped open her stomach with his sharp claws, and flew out. The gods were all impressed by his quick thinking and intelligence. "Oh brave [[Maruti]]. Thanks to you killing the demons, we can live here peacefully. We bless you," the gods praised.
