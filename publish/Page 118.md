[[Bharata]]'s words were that he would enter the fire if there was the slightest delay in returning after the completion of the exile period. The period of exile was coming to an end. [[Rama]], along with his entourage, left for [[Ayodhya]] to meet [[Bharata]] without delay. Everyone travelled through the sky in [[Pushpaka]] [[Vimana]], which belonged to [[Vibhishana]], and reached [[Kosala]]. When the city of [[Ayodhya]] appeared, [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] bowed to it with respect.

[[Rama]] met [[Bharata]] at [[Nandigrama]]. [[Bharata]] was overwhelmed at the return of his beloved [[Rama]]. Everyone shed happy tears. [[Bharata]] returned the golden slippers back to [[Rama]] and said that his responsibilities were completed. [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Bharata]] changed their attire and wore the clothes that were fit for the princes. [[Bharata]] took [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Sita]] in a golden chariot and brought them to [[Ayodhya]].
