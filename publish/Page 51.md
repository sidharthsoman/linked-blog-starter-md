Following [[Kabandha]]'s words, [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] left for the [[Pampa]] region. There they met [[Shabari]], an old woman and a disciple of [[Matanga]] Muni, at the [[Matanga]] ashram. Following the instructions of [[Matanga]], [[Shabari]] had been keeping herself alive just to meet [[Rama]]. Her guru had told her that she would attain salvation by seeing [[Rama]]. Believing that [[Rama]] would come, [[Shabari]] had collected fruits and berries with great devotion and love. She offered them all to [[Rama]] with motherly affection. With [[Rama]]'s consent, [[Shabari]] decided to leave for the heavenly abode. She entered a fire and went to heaven as a divine being.
